Luke previously co-founded DAOHQ.co, the marketplace for DAOs. Before dropping out of Harvard, Luke studied CS and Economics on a full-ride; founded Erevna, which hosted research projects and hackathons for over ten thousand students; and was the youngest researcher at Opportunity Insights, the Census Bureau, and Steve Ballmer's USAFacts.

How many cyborgs does it take to change a light bulb?

To answer this question, we need to know the second law of thermodynamics, which states that overall entropy doesn’t decrease.

Upon discovering this law, James Maxwell had a nightmare about some finite engine, a demon. This demon controls a small massless door between two gas chambers. As gas particles bounce around, the demon allows the high-energy gas particles into one chamber and low-energy into the other. The chambers have become more ordered and the demon has decreased entropy.

It took well over a hundred years for physicists to solve this issue, and the theory is that Maxwell’s demon needs information to know when to open the door. This information must have taken energy to collect and organize, and that information would have created more entropy in the universe than the entropy lost in the gas chambers.

Energy was turned into information. This is what Plurigrid does. Plurigrid tokenizes electricity. Just like Maxwell’s demon, we are the door. We’re at the door between web -3, electricity, and web3, blockchains. We’re at the door between oil, the most valuable physical resource, and data, the most valuable digital resource. Plurigrid turns oil into data, microgrids into markets, and BTUs into blockchain tokens.

And like Maxwell, our nightmare is gas-related. The Russian invasion of Ukraine wreaked havoc in the energy markets as their gas got boycotted. Millions of tons of carbon get released by wildfires that cause blackouts in California every year. Texan Gas wasn’t enough to prevent energy prices from skyrocketing during their snap freeze largely caused by climate change caused by Big Oil.

The world needs better electricity coordination to recover and deal with increasingly frequent and damaging energy crisis events. Efficient P2P trading would save energy producers, traders, and consumers millions of dollars.

So when we return to the question, how many cyborgs does it take to change a lightbulb, we found the answer to be 1: one cyborgcamp, one team, and one startup. 

So then, our startup question is "how do we change energy systems"? How do we connect smart devices, wisely? We're at the door between data and oil, microgrids and markets, carbon and credits, and elections and electrons, and we're just opening the door. Last September, over 1.5 trillion dollars was needed to keep energy trading just in Europe. 

Bitcoin was created in response to the Great Financial Crisis; I’m honored to be working on Plurigrid as a response to the Great Energy Crisis. 

I’m excited to work with you all as Chief of Staff. I’ll be responsible for coordinating money and people, which practically means fundraising, operations, and communications. This includes review of legal, finances, and logistics. 

Let’s reverse entropy, and

Let there be light."
