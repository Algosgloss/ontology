### Proposed Gameplay (Revised):
Metagame: to create a closed cybernetic loop involving humans, agents, simulations, and physical configurations, to demonstrate how intents may be aggregated into physical-reality outcomes and to illustrate the principles of amplifying agency through agentic intermediaries.

**Goal of gameplayers**: the goal is to form the largest coalition by the end of the game.

**0: Extitutional Peer Discovery and Formation of Coalitions**
Participants engage in individual conversations with an overarching Plurigrid Unhack agent, where they provide information about their favorite readings and values on governance, DAOs, optimal control, and other relevant topics. Based on the participants' topic and view alignments, the agent summarizes their responses and elicits their values, creating a manifesto out of this. The agent then shares the participants' manifestos with potential new coalition members in order to encourage them to join other coalitions.

Participants then mingle and discuss, using a provided paper and pen template, to find coalition partners whose intentions for the uses of the lamp, preferred voting weight and proposal type, and other implicit or explicit criteria lead to "soft consensus" and intention formation.

**1: Instantiation of up to 9 Plurigrids**
The formed coalitions use the Plurigrid app or Zulip to submit a proposal for the creation of a new subDAO to the Plurigrid Unhack DAO. The proposals get voted on by the judges and the final team list, with up to 9 subDAOs, is announced.

**2: Initial Gameplay and Configuration**
Coalitions must cooperate amongst themselves to come up with valid configuration states for the lamp that meet the constraints. The coalitions interact with their agent to understand the validity of their configurations. The agent will run simulations to see if a configuration is valid and explain the results to the coalition members.

**3: Continued Gameplay**
As each Plurigrid's participants and conversational agents engage in the attempt to aggregate their intents for the lamp, the internal vote by each Plurgirid Unhack's subDAOs at any time can engage with the governance via the Plurigrid app, DAO DAO UI, or Zulip conversational agent dedicated to their Plurigrid in the corresponding topic of the:

- the choice of brightness
- the choice of color
- the choice the prompt component that generates group description / Stable Diffusion image, and the riffs using riffusion
- the team choice of objectives and how to accomplish them, e.g. perfect or imperfect information game, how dynamic to be about the choice, whether to use the standard contracts or to attempt to create a new one

Coalitions will try to poach members from other coalitions by all means necessary, including persuasion and vibe-sharing. Agents may assist in this effort by sharing a coalitions values and answering questions. The coalition with the largest number of members by the end of the game wins.
