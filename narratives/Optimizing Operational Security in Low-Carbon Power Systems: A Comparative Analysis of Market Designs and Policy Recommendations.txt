EARLY DRAFT NEEDS TO BE COMPOSED WITH OTHER THREADS

I. Executive Summary

The integration of low-carbon resources into power systems presents significant technical and economic challenges for maintaining operational security. This report evaluates five canonical market designs to address these challenges: centralized procurement, decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation, decentralized procurement via network access, hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement, and decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination. Each market design has its unique benefits and drawbacks, making them more or less suitable for different models and scenarios.

Centralized procurement and decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation both receive a final rating of 3/5, as they are less effective in certain models due to their lack of centralized or decentralized coordination. Decentralized procurement via network access also receives a final rating of 3/5, as it is better suited for the Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) and Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) models but not as effective under the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model. Hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement and decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination both receive a final rating of 4/5, as they offer more flexibility and balance between centralized and decentralized decision-making.

In conclusion, policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs for operational security in low-carbon power systems. Decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination, as a hybrid market design, offers a flexible and adaptable approach to address these challenges in various scenarios and contexts. By establishing local platforms for coordination and collective action, this design promotes efficient resource allocation and supports complex common pool resources and coordinated renewable expansion.

II. Introduction
A. Background on low-carbon power systems
Low-carbon power systems aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change by incorporating renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower, as well as energy storage and demand-side management technologies. These systems require a rethinking of conventional power system planning and operation due to the intermittent and distributed nature of renewable energy sources, changing demand patterns, and the need to decarbonize the electricity sector.

B. Importance of operational security
Operational security is essential for maintaining the reliability, stability, and quality of power systems. It involves ensuring the continuous balance between electricity supply and demand, managing grid congestion, and maintaining voltage and frequency within acceptable limits. As low-carbon resources are integrated into the grid, maintaining operational security becomes increasingly complex due to the variability and uncertainty of renewable generation, the need for flexible resources, and the interactions between transmission and distribution systems. Addressing these challenges requires innovative market designs, regulatory frameworks, and coordination mechanisms that can efficiently allocate resources and ensure system security while promoting the integration of low-carbon resources.

C. Overview of market designs
This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of five canonical market designs tailored to address the challenges of operational security in low-carbon power systems:

1. Centralized Procurement: A market design where a central authority is responsible for procuring system security services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.

2. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation: This market design relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities, promoting market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation.

3. Decentralized Procurement via Network Access: A market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources, promoting market-driven investment decisions while addressing power system security challenges in low-carbon grids.

4. Hybrid Centralized-Decentralized Procurement: This market design combines elements of centralized and decentralized procurement, allowing for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities while still providing flexibility for local decision-making.

5. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination: A hybrid market design that combines decentralized decision-making with coordinated efforts through local platforms, allowing for local coordination and investment decisions while still promoting overall system security, making it suitable for managing complex common pool resources and promoting coordinated renewable expansion.

Each market design has unique benefits and drawbacks, making them more or less suitable for different models and scenarios. The report examines these market designs in detail, assessing their suitability for various power system models, including Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP), Generation Expansion Problem (GEP), and Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) models. It also provides insights and recommendations for policymakers and regulators to consider when selecting a market design for operational security in low-carbon power systems.

III. Centralized Procurement
A. Overview

Centralized procurement is a market design in which one or more central agencies are responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. The central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.

B. Benefits

1. Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.
2. Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.
3. Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.

C. Drawbacks

1. Less effective in GEP and TEP models: Centralized procurement may not be as effective in the GEP and TEP models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination. In these cases, decentralized procurement may be more suitable.
2. Potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency: Centralized procurement may introduce bureaucratic hurdles and potential inefficiencies, as decisions must be made by a central authority rather than individual market participants.

D. Suitability for different models

As a market design, centralized procurement is best suited for the CEP model, where joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is crucial for maintaining operational security in low-carbon power systems. However, for the GEP and TEP models, where decentralized coordination may be more effective, other market designs might be better suited. Policymakers and regulators should consider the specific characteristics of their power systems when selecting a market design for operational security.

IV. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation

A. Overview

Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This approach aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.

B. Benefits

1. Market-driven investment decisions: Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.

2. Incentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.

3. Better suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.

C. Drawbacks

1. Lack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.

2. Potential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.

3. Complexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.

D. Suitability for Different Models

Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.

V. Decentralized Procurement via Network Access

A. Overview

Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources. This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.

B. Benefits

1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.

2. Encourages Competition and Innovation: By allowing multiple connecting resources to participate in the procurement of system security services, Decentralized Procurement via Network Access fosters competition and innovation in the market. This can result in the development of more effective and cost-efficient solutions for maintaining system security.

3. Better Suited for TEP and GEP Models: This market design may be more effective under the TEP and GEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. This enables connecting resources to address system security challenges in a more targeted manner.

C. Drawbacks

1. Lack of Centralized Coordination: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access may not be as effective under the CEP model, which requires joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The lack of centralized coordination in this market design may limit its ability to address system security challenges effectively in such scenarios.

2. Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.

D. Suitability for different models

Decentralized Procurement via Network Access offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required. This market design is better suited for the TEP and GEP models, where it allows resources to make investments based on local conditions and constraints. In contrast, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the lack of centralized coordination. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.
