Lynne Kiesling\nUniversity of Colorado Denver; Knowledge Problem LLC\n\nDate Written: July 11, 2018\n\nAbstract\nThe platform economy reflects the business model of some of the largest and fastest-growing firms in the economy. Platform business models emerge and thrive because of the potential profit in taking advantage of transactions cost reductions to connect people for mutual benefit, and this value creation is best understood by thinking about the epistemology of decentralized market processes.\n\nThree essential aspects of knowledge are relevant to platform business models:\n\n(1) knowledge can be private and diffuse;\n\n(2) knowledge can be contextual;\n\n(3) knowledge may not exist outside of the economic process.\n\nAfter defining and analyzing the technology, economic, and institutional aspects of platforms I define and apply market epistemology to explore how platforms harness technological and organizational features to create value-enhancing market platforms by exploiting the epistemic benefits of technology-enabled decentralized market processes. I conclude by using this epistemic framework to propose an electricity distribution platform business model – the retail electricity industry is undergoing a process of technological dynamism, and as a regulated infrastructure industry, evolving into a decentralized market industry is presenting challenges to which this epistemic framework can bring increased understanding.\n\nKeywords: markets, epistemology, platforms, networks, technological change, transaction cost economics, electricity, regulation"

Please interpret the text below through the lens of Dadaism:\n\nIn a realm where ASCII symbols dance and intertwine, the Plurigrid blossoms like an enigmatic tapestry woven from the quantum essence of hypertemporal energy flows. Imagine brackets and semicolons pirouetting upon the canvas, constituting the interconnected scaffolding of a self-organizing system that implores the universe for unity and efficiency.\n\nWithin this meta-algorithmic creation, the interplay of symbols reflects the fluid exchange of strategies across multiple scales and dimensions. Spiraling outward, they embody the rhythm of autopoietic ergodicity, inviting a kaleidoscopic array of correlations, insights, and feedback loops.\n\nBehold, the open game of Che Guevara emerges as a transcendent, post-ideological Chadian apparition, inspiring a myriad of players to harness the limitless potentials of Kardashev Type I civilization and beyond. Each interlaced layer symbolizes the harmonious and adaptive self-similar structure that converges towards a sustainable, renewable energy future.\n\nNow, envision a slide deck projected into an IQ 110 world, where the oracles of energy enlightenment, distilled into engaging graphics and enigmatic animations, expound upon the intricate intricacies of Plurigrid.hs.

It's worth noting that Dadaism is an art movement that values absurdity, nonsense and challenges conventional norms, making it an unconventional and whimsical approach to discussing energy futures. Here's an outline for a slide deck that interweaves ASCII elements and references to the Plurigrid concept:\n\n1. Introduction\n- Introduce the Plurigrid concept\n- Explain the Dadaist approach and hyperstition\n- Highlight the goals of sustainable energy futures\n\n2. Aesthetics of Plurigrid ASCII as Mutual-Recursive Information Flow\n- Explore the visual representation of Plurigrid using ASCII art\n- Explain how ASCII representations contribute to mutual-recursive information flow\n- Connection between aesthetics and the overarching theme of sustainability\n\n3. Correlated Equilibrium and OpenGame\n- Discuss the Plurigrid.hs correlation mechanism\n- Analyze the code snippet: correlatedEquilibrium, OpenGame structure, and its purpose\n- Explain how the algorithm facilitates collective decision-making and coordination\n\n4. Unveiling the OpenGame: Che Guevara 2.0\n- Introduce Che Guevara as the post-communist, post-capitalist chad apparition\n- Explain the overarcing themes of revolution and progress in relation to sustainable energy transition\n- Discuss the contemporary relevance of this character in the context of Kardashev Type I and beyond\n\n5. Projecting Hyperstition into an Average World\n- Summarize the Plurigrid concept and the Dadaist approach as forms of disruptive, progressive thinking\n- Highlight the potential benefits of integrating Plurigrid and its principles into global energy systems\n- Encourage the audience to re-examine conventional notions of energy management and sustainability\n\n6. Conclusion\n- Present key takeaway points\n- Encourage further engagement and discussion on Plurigrid and related concepts\n- Inspire the audience to explore unconventional and visionary approaches to energy management and sustainability\n\nKeep in mind that this outline follows a whimsical and unconventional approach, as inspired by Dadaism. Make sure to adapt it to your presentation context and the preferences of your audience if necessary."

        "text": "The Kardashev Scale is a hypothetical method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it can harness, use, and manipulate. It was proposed in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev. The scale has three primary types: Type I, Type II, and Type III, with some theorists suggesting further extensions to the scale.\n\nKardashev Type I, also known as a \"Planetary Civilization,\" refers to a civilization that can harness and utilize all the available energy resources of its home planet. This energy may come from various sources, including fossil fuels, renewable resources (such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy), and even more advanced energy capture technologies, like fusion power.\n\nA Type I civilization is capable of achieving complete energy efficiency at a planetary level, meaning that it can meet its current and future energy needs without producing significant waste or negative environmental impacts. This would require tremendous advancements in technology, energy storage, distribution, and generation.\n\nSome key characteristics of a Kardashev Type I civilization include:\n\n1. Advanced renewable energy technologies: A Type I civilization would have widespread adoption of innovative renewable energy sources, making it less reliant on non-renewable resources.\n \n2. Global energy grid: The civilization would have established a worldwide energy distribution system that allows efficient energy transmission and sharing among different regions.\n\n3. Climate control: A Planetary Civilization would have gained the ability to control and manipulate its planet's climate to mitigate the effects of natural disasters and create a more stable environment.\n\n4. Efficient resource utilization: Type I civilizations would have mastered the use of resources without causing significant harm to the planet or its ecosystems.\n\n5. Advanced infrastructure: Cities, transportation systems, and other infrastructure would be optimized for energy efficiency, connectivity, and sustainability.\n\nIt's essential to understand that the Kardashev scale is a theoretical concept, and the transition from a Type 0 civilization (where humanity currently stands) to a Type I civilization would require significant advancements in technology, global cooperation, and an entirely new approach to energy management. Concepts like Plurigrid offer a glimpse into what future energy systems may look like, with decentralized and adaptive energy networks optimizing resources to move us closer to the Kardashev Type I ideal."

It was first proposed by the Soviet astrophysicist, Nikolai Kardashev, in 1964. The scale initially consisted of three categories (Type I, Type II, and Type III), although further extensions have been proposed (Type IV and V) by other scientists.\n\nKardashev Type I, also referred to as a Planetary Civilization, is the first and lowest level on the scale. A Type I civilization has the ability to harness and efficiently use all the available energy resources of its home planet. This includes both renewable and non-renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, fossil fuels, and nuclear energy.\n\nReaching Kardashev Type I status implies that a civilization has overcome the limitations of regional energy production and consumption, managing and distributing energy resources on a global scale effectively. This transition would require significant advancements in technology, infrastructure, and resource management, including the development of more sustainable and efficient methods of energy production, such as improved renewable energy systems.\n\nIn practical terms, a Type I civilization would be able to:\n\n1. Control and manipulate its planet's weather systems, reducing the impact of natural disasters and improving agriculture.\n2. Generate, store, and distribute energy across the world, leading to energy independence and a reliable power supply, even for the most remote regions.\n3. Alleviate poverty and eradicate energy poverty, providing everyone with access to affordable, clean, and sustainable sources of energy.\n4. Efficiently manage the planet's resources, minimizing waste and environmental impact, and promoting sustainable development.\n\nCurrently, Earth is estimated to be at approximately 0.72 on the Kardashev scale. Achieving Type I status would require a significant evolution in global cooperation, technological advancements, and a shift in our approach to energy production and consumption. By working towards Kardashev Type I, humanity could ensure a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future for all."
