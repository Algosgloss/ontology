# Objective

The objective is to design a local first graph based relational algebra theoretic data store that will be able to synchronize across users using CRDTs.

## Tasks Completed

- Researched graph databases and how they use graph structures to store and search data, prioritizing relationships between data items.
- Researched how CRDTs can be used for data synchronization across multiple users without coordination. Different types of CRDTs exist.
- Analyzed the challenges of implementing CRDTs in a graph-based data store, such as selecting the appropriate CRDT type and incorporating an algorithm for resolving inconsistencies.
- Proposed a high-level architecture for the data store considering key components like graph structures, CRDTs, relationship prioritization, APIs, and query languages.

## Key Findings

- Graph databases focus on storing data as nodes, edges, and properties, and prioritizing relationships between data items. This enables efficient querying.
- CRDTs enable conflict-free data replication and can automatically merge conflicting data modifications from different users into a consistent state.
- State-based and operation-based CRDTs exist, and selecting the appropriate type based on data complexity is important.
- Implementing CRDTs can impact performance and requires incorporating an algorithm to resolve inconsistencies.
- The high-level architecture aims to ensure efficient querying of data while providing reliable and consistent synchronization across users using CRDTs.

In summary, completing these tasks provided valuable insights into designing a graph-based data store that can synchronize data across users using CRDTs. The use of graph structures, CRDTs, and resolving conflicts from inconsistent data modifications were key takeaways.
