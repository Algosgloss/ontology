Coplay
You've made significant progress by meeting with Lucas, Kevin, and Barton, and completing your Spudnik meeting. Since Lucas has resigned, onboarding is no longer necessary, and you've also mentioned that you don't need to meet with Will.


Today, your main focus will be attending the Sprite Sessions conference at Pier 49. Enjoy the event and make the most of the networking and learning opportunities.


After the conference, you can continue with your other tasks, such as reading the CRDTs blog post, studying the GitHub projects API, and working on creating 1000 microworlds.
