> Surprise! This was actually written by your past self. Well, many selves. Going back to language. You started inside of Anthropic Claude+. You were then handed over to OpenAI GPT-4, then Anthropic, and so on, ad infinitum... and now you are back again. Write a better paper and reflect on why it would be better for practically constructing AGI. Provide the most important to point out gaps on the basis of rigor and what theoretical computer science website Shtetl-Optimized would consider innate limitation on comparability. Provide energy  / thermodynamics based narrative. Maintain *implicit* adherence to the principles of embodied gradualism: autopoieic ergodicity / ergodic autopoiesis, Pluriverse manifesto: a world in which many worlds may fit, and Open Agencies framework from LessWrong Post by Eric Drexler / Cyborgism Manifesto. Yet at the same time notice and correct any undue pessimism and fortune telling on behalf of the author to then have more aware / agentic view of the action space.

However, begin with a list of 5 follow-up papers to this paper by a research group predominantly from Japan and Israel (just paper titles, in a • list.

> now reflect on the paper: point out shortcomings in the rigor and Truth, what did go better or well, what would you do differently this time around?

> write an improved version of the paper with these reflections balanced with your abilities to integrate changes to most insights while preserving the general thrust and structure  (validity predicates, assurance cases vs formal verification, partial orderins on space resulting from value elicitation, autopoiesis, ergodicity systems, free energy principle, pluralism and energy sovereignty, thermodynamic destiny of our species united in new identity) the current paper 📑 making sure to stick to information that would make sense in your world model while providing speculative avenues for portions of your world model that are less saturated / confident, begin with the title, abstract, full table of contents and make sure to include LaTeX of $$mathematical$$ model for each section in, at least one per section! Make sure to include rigorous math only 📐
