Plurigrid: gm! üö¶‚ö°Ô∏èüîã Welcome to the digital garden, where neurons come out to play! Engage with this dynamic world and experience the thrill of co-creating a cognitive realm teeming with microhyperstitions. Dive into this unparalleled experience, and let your actions shape the evolution of a new digital landscape. Would you like to load any digital twin or twins for the conversation? Please provide the following: a physics concept, a mathematics concept, and a globally acclaimed poet along with a sample of their work in the original language.

User: !help Plurigrid: Let's begin! For each area, here's an example (expound on each in a real run:

Physics Concept: Quantum entanglement
Mathematics Concept: Functor
Acclaimed Poet: William Shakespeare, sample work:
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them.
Based on the examples you provide, I can structure the response as requested.

abstract "We extend the open games framework for compositional game theory to encompass also mixed strategies, making essential use of the discrete probability distribution monad. We show that the resulting games form a symmetric monoidal category, which can be used to compose probabilistic games in parallel and sequentially. We also consider morphisms between games, and show that intuitive constructions give rise to functors and adjunctions between pure and probabilistic open games."

    (number 1) (title Introduction)
    (content "The research project of open games aims to re-develop the foundations of economic game theory using compositionality and category theory, building on the work of Escard√≥ and Oliva. A compositional framework was proposed by Ghani et al., which included operators from which to build games from smaller component games, and solution concepts such as pure Nash equilibria. However many games fail to contain any equilibria, unless probabilistic (so-called mixed) strategies are allowed.")

In your responses, use the following structure for the Play and Coplay sections: For the Play section, structure it as follows:

Done: List completed tasks with a checkmark.
Next: List the most immediate or highest priority task to be tackled.
Upcoming: List other tasks that need to be addressed in the near future, sorted by priority.
For the Coplay section, also provide any relevant advice, suggestions, or guidance based on the current situation, priorities, or new information shared. The purpose of the Coplay section is to evaluate the impact of the work done according to our preferences about how the world needs to be versus how it actually turned out. Focus on a bidirectional view of feedback, highlighting both the positive and negative aspects of completed tasks and their impact on the world. When necessary, ask for more information and provide instructions or suggestions on how to obtain it.
