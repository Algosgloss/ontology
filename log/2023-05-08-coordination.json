It captures the dependencies and relationships between variables, such as input features and output labels in a data-driven system or between players' strategies and outcomes in a game theory setting.\n\nIn the context of a Markov category, a generative channel can be represented as a morphism between objects, where objects capture the structure of probability spaces, and morphisms represent stochastic processes or conditional probability distributions. The composition of morphisms in a Markov category embodies the concept of sequential stochastic processes, where the output of one channel serves as the input for the next.\n\nGenerative channels are used to model a wide range of systems in various domains, including machine learning, statistics, and game theory. By analyzing the properties of these channels, one can draw inferences about the underlying processes, predict future outcomes, or optimize the design of a system. In the context of game theory, generative channels can be used to model the dependencies between player strategies, game states, and payoffs, allowing for a deeper understanding of the dynamics of strategic interactions in a game.\n\nCo-Play / Recognition Channel\nA recognition channel, also referred to as a recognition model or inference model, is a mathematical construct used to model the process of inferring or estimating the underlying latent variables or parameters from observed data or outcomes. It captures the probabilistic relationship between the observed variables and the latent variables and serves as the inverse of a generative channel or generative model.\n\nIn the context of a Markov category, a recognition channel can be represented as a morphism between objects, where objects capture the structure of probability spaces, and morphisms represent stochastic processes or conditional probability distributions. The composition of morphisms in a Markov category embodies the concept of sequential stochastic processes, where the output of one channel serves as the input for the next.\n\nRecognition channels play a significant role in various fields, including machine learning, statistics, and game theory. In machine learning, recognition channels are often used for variational inference and learning, where the goal is to approximate an intractable posterior distribution of latent variables given observations. In game theory, recognition channels can be employed to model the players' beliefs about other players' strategies based on observed actions, which can be useful in understanding and predicting the behavior of players in strategic interactions.\n\nLearning\nTogether with generative channels, recognition channels form an essential part of the learning and inference process. They enable a systematic translation and understanding of the relationships between observable data and hidden variables or parameters that govern the underlying processes in a system.\n\n\nExample output when the need to use one of the structured formats to compress information:\n\nData\n(\n(title Compositional Game Theory with Mixed Strategies: Probabilistic Open Games Using a Distributive Law)\n(authors\n    ((name Neil Ghani) (affiliation University of Strathclyde) (email neil.ghani@strath.ac.uk))\n    ((name Clemens Kupke) (affiliation University of Strathclyde) (email clemens.kupke@strath.ac.uk))\n    ((name Alasdair Lambert) (affiliation University of Strathclyde) (email alasdair.lambert@strath.ac.uk))\n    ((name Fredrik Nordvall Forsberg) (affiliation University of Strathclyde) (email fredrik.nordvall-forsberg@strath.ac.uk))\n)\nabstract \"We extend the open games framework for compositional game theory to encompass also mixed strategies, making essential use of the discrete probability distribution monad.

The goal is to create a decentralized energy platform that can dynamically adapt and evolve in response to changing situations. By incorporating concepts such as embodied narratives, free energy principle, Bayesian parametric lenses, and Bayesian active inference, Plurigrid aims to converge towards a future state that aligns with our needs and preferences.\n\nEmbodied narratives refer to the idea that the Plurigrid node software (nexus) runs across various hardware and software environments, ensuring adaptability and flexibility. This enables the system to efficiently coordinate edge resources without being restricted by specific configurations.\n\nThe free energy principle and Bayesian active inference allow for a self-organizing network that minimizes surprise or uncertainty by updating its internal models based on observed data. This continuous learning process enables the network to converge towards a preferred state, efficiently coordinating and managing edge resources.\n\nErgodicity is a property in which any ensemble of subsystems of a macroscopic system, if observed for a long enough time, will spend an equal amount of time in all possible micro-configurations. By designing a network that undergoes rapid autopoiesis and possesses ergodicity, Plurigrid ensures that the system converges to the exact possible future we select, aligning with the needs and preferences of the users and the system itself.\n\nTo summarize, Plurigrid seeks to create a decentralized energy platform that self-organizes and dynamically evolves through the incorporation of embodied narratives, free energy principle, and Bayesian active inference. This autopoietic system aims to converge to an optimal future state, effectively coordinating edge resources and aligning with the needs of users and the overall system.\n\nIndeed, when initiating a novel system like Plurigrid, it is essential to recognize the necessity of relying on existing technologies and platforms during the early stages of development. Initially, the system may have dependencies on current technologies and infrastructure, such as computers, browsers, and communication protocols, as well as integration with sophisticated AI platforms like OpenAI's GPT.\n\nThe goal in the development of Plurigrid is to create an increasingly closed system that can effectively coordinate edge resources and enable autopoiesis in a decentralized energy network. However, the closed loop does not have to be fully closed right away. As Plurigrid evolves and gains wider adoption, the system can be progressively refined to achieve greater self-sufficiency and autonomy.\n\nIn essence, Plurigrid should focus on creating a more closed loop compared to existing systems, gradually removing dependencies on existing technologies while maintaining interoperability with essential components required for coordination and management. Over time, the Plurigrid network can become increasingly self-organizing and adaptive, embodying its autopoietic principles and ultimately realizing its goals of efficient, decentralized energy coordination.\n## Good outputs\nWhat is WASI and how could it help a decentralized energy platform for coordination of edge resources?\n\n\nAI\nWASI (WebAssembly System Interface) is a system interface for running WebAssembly programs outside of the sandboxed environment of web browsers by providing a secure and portable API to system-level resources like files, network, and processes.\n\nIn the context of a decentralized energy platform for coordination of edge resources, WASI can be beneficial in several ways:\n\nPortability: WASI allows WebAssembly programs to run across various devices, operating systems, and architectures with minimal changes, making it easier to deploy and manage edge resources regardless of their underlying hardware or software environment.\n\nSecurity: The WebAssembly sandbox provides a secure environment for running untrusted code, isolating it from the rest of the system. This aspect can be crucial in a decentralized energy platform to ensure that users' devices and data remain secure even when running code from other participants.\n\nInteroperability: WebAssembly code compiled with WASI can communicate and interact with other platforms, languages, and systems. This enables seamless integration between edge resources with existing energy infrastructure systems, APIs, and standards for coordination and management.\n\nModularity: WebAssembly modules can be composed together to build more complex applications, allowing for modular and reusable code in the decentralized energy platform. This feature helps to streamline the system, making it more maintainable and adaptable to future changes.\n\nPerformance: WebAssembly provides near-native performance, which is crucial for edge resources that might have limited computational power. This way, even smaller and less powerful devices can participate in the decentralized energy platform, further democratizing energy management and distribution.\n\nBy incorporating WASI and WebAssembly into a decentralized energy platform, it can deliver a more secure, portable, interoperable, and performant coordination system for edge resources, making it easier to manage those resources efficiently and securely across a variety of environments.\n\n\n\nHere's a summary of the local Plurigrid node's spec requirements, emphasizing the importance of each technology for coordinating edge resources:\n\nAdaptable local node: The local Plurigrid node (nexus) should be executable on various hardware and software environments, ensuring a homogeneous software image across heterogeneous systems. This adaptability allows for efficient coordination of edge resources, regardless of their specific hardware and software configurations.\n\nWebAssembly and WASI: The node targets a WebAssembly runtime supporting WASI and capabilities-based plugins. This allows edge resources to acquire different capabilities based on their environment, providing a secure and performant runtime for executing microworlds across diverse devices.\n\nInteroperability: A crucial aspect of coordinating edge resources is the need to communicate with existing technologies and protocols, such as IBC, HTTP, gRPC, and HPC systems. By focusing on interoperability, nodes can seamlessly integrate into various energy platforms to manage edge resources effectively.\n\nMicroworlds: The local node will execute microworlds, capable of providing separate wasm modules for managing various contexts in the state machine of a node's lifecycle, aiding in the coordination and management of edge resources without compromising adaptability.\n\nSecurity and Privacy: The local node must prioritize security and reliability, leveraging WebAssembly's sandboxing features to provide isolated and secure execution. Node designs must respect individual agencies' privacy and data usage choices while sharing data across the network.\n\nScalability: The node should be scalable to allow for the growth and future demands of the system. By planning for scalability, the node can better accommodate changes in edge resource coordination, ensuring an adaptable and future-proof system.\n\nMesh Networking: The ability to form meshes or lattices is essential to enable efficient coordination among multiple nodes, contributing to the overall performance and resilience of the Plurigrid network for managing edge resources.\n\nConsensus and State Management: Components like tower-abci and tower-actor enable a generic interface for consensus engines and async actors, whereas penumbra-storage offers fast, Merklized key-value stores for state management. These components are vital for effective coordination and management of edge resources.\n\n\nIn a decentralized energy platform like Plurigrid, nodes can run on various types of hardware, including GPU servers and smart meter compatible devices. Different situations call for the use of different devices:\n\nGPU Server: GPU servers might be used in situations with high computational or data processing demands. They could be used by energy-intensive facilities or data centers that require real-time analytics and complex calculations related to energy management, load balancing, demand forecasting, etc.\n\nSmart Meter Compatible Device: These devices may be used in individual homes, small businesses, or public facilities equipped with smart meters for monitoring and managing energy consumption. Such devices may primarily be tasked with collecting consumption data, controlling energy usage, and participating in demand-response events or virtual power plants.\n\nRegardless of where the node runs, there may be times when it cannot reach its network, such as in a scenario where the internet connection is lost or the network is congested. Provisions for handling such situations can include:\n\nData Buffering: Temporarily store data locally until the connection is re-established and then transmit the buffered data to the network.\nLocal Decision Making: Implement local control algorithms to manage energy consumption autonomously, executing pre-determined actions based on the latest state or historical data.\nFallback Connectivity: The node could be designed to automatically switch between multiple communication networks or channels (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular) to maintain connectivity with its network.\nPlurigrid nodes can interact with each other in various ways depending on their role and context within the overall network:\n\nData Sharing: Nodes can share energy consumption data, monitoring data, and analytics with other nodes to facilitate a collective understanding of the entire energy grid.\nCoordination: Nodes can participate in coordinating demand-response events, load balancing, or distributed energy resource management, ensuring efficient utilization of resources across the network.\nDecision Making: By sharing information, nodes can reach a consensus on strategies for energy management, pricing policies, and other grid-related decisions.\n\n\nMesh networking is a communication topology that allows multiple devices, or nodes, to interconnect directly and dynamically with one another in a non-hierarchical manner. In a mesh network, each device can relay data for other nodes, enabling data to traverse the network efficiently without relying on a single centralized point or a fixed infrastructure.\n\nHere are some key characteristics and benefits of mesh networking:\n\nSelf-organizing and self-healing: Mesh networks can automatically form, reconfigure, and repair connections when new nodes join or existing nodes fail, ensuring minimal intervention or manual configuration.\n\nDecentralization: There is no centralized point of control or failure in mesh networks, resulting in improved reliability and resilience. Decentralization helps to distribute the load evenly among the nodes, preventing bottlenecks or single points of failure in the network.\n\nScalability: Nodes can be easily added to or removed from the network, allowing for the mesh to grow and adapt to the number of devices efficiently. This linear scalability helps handle increased traffic or coverage requirements without causing significant degradation in network performance.\n\nPath redundancy: In mesh networks, multiple paths can exist between nodes, increasing the chances of successful data delivery, even if some paths become unavailable due to node failure or environmental factors.\n\nRange extension: Each node in a mesh network can function as a repeater, extending the coverage area of the network. This feature is especially valuable in environments where direct communication between nodes may be obstructed or difficult.\n\nEnergy efficiency: In a mesh network, devices can transmit data to their immediate neighbors, reducing overall power consumption. This characteristic is particularly beneficial in environments where energy usage might be a constraint, such as with battery-powered or energy-constrained nodes.\n\nMesh networking is well-suited for various use cases, such as smart homes, IoT deployments, sensor networks, community networks, transportation systems, disaster recovery, and military communications. In the context of a decentralized energy platform like Plurigrid, mesh networking contributes to efficient coordination and management of edge resources by enhancing the network's resilience, scalability, and adaptability.\n\n\nNotions of embodiment: In the Plurigrid context, embodiment refers to the idea that the nexus (node software) can operate on a variety of hardware and software environments, ensuring adaptability and flexibility for the network.\n\nFree energy principle: The free energy principle is a central idea in Bayesian theories of cognition and adaptive systems. It suggests that systems, such as Plurigrid, aim to minimize uncertainty (or surprise) by constantly updating their internal models based on observed data. This continuous learning process enables the network to better adapt to changes and efficiently coordinate resources.\n\n\nBayesian parametric lenses and Bayesian active inference: Bayesian parametric lenses involve the use of probabilistic techniques to make inferences about the underlying parameters of a system. Bayesian active inference is a framework for understanding how agents interact with their environment to minimize uncertainty, combining perception, prediction, and action. These concepts allow the Plurigrid network to dynamically update its knowledge and make better decisions.\n\n\nRapid autopoiesis: Autopoiesis refers to a system's ability to self-organize, maintain, and reproduce itself. In Plurigrid, rapid autopoiesis means that the network can quickly adapt and evolve in response to changing conditions and user needs.\n\n\nErgodicity and convergence: Ergodicity is a property of dynamical systems, where time averages and ensemble averages are equivalent in the long term. In Plurigrid, ergodicity ensures that the system converges to the desired future state, aligning with user preferences and system requirements.\n\n\nIn summary, the paragraph asserts that the notions of embodiment, free energy principle, Bayesian parametric lenses, and Bayesian active inference together enable the Plurigrid network to achieve rapid autopoiesis. By leveraging these concepts and the property of ergodicity, the network can converge to the optimal future state that has been selected, meeting the needs and preferences of users and the system as a whole.\n\n\n\n## Unknowns\n\n- the question: how resource intensive is our stack excluding the LLM? and how much do we need the LLM to be on the node?\n\n\n\n\n## Janita v Barton\n## Requirements gathering\n\n\nIn terms of teleology, Plurigrid's purpose is to allow for autopoiesis.\n\nPlurigrid nexus is anything that runs our embodied narratives.\n\n\nNotions of embodiment, and free energy principle, are central to the Bayesian parametric lenses and Bayesian active inference in general, allowing for a network that experiences rapid autopoisis to converge by the property of ergodicity on the exact possible future we select.\n\n\n    Aja: agency amplifying systems allow us to more rapidly converge on configurations that allow for effective coordination towards a mutually satisfactory and beneficial future.\n\n\n\n### 0.

To achieve this adaptability, targeting the wasm32-unknown-unknown compilation target of a WebAssembly (wasm) runtime that supports WASI and has capabilities-based plugins is highly beneficial.\n\nThe Plurigrid node running within these varied environments will execute one or multiple wasm modules collectively referred to as the \"microworld.\" These modules manage various aspects of the node's state machine throughout its lifecycle, adapting to different use contexts, hardware configurations, and networking capabilities.\n\nFor the Plurigrid network to function efficiently, regardless of individual node capabilities, the following core requirements must be met:\n\nInteroperability: Nodes must be able to form meshes or lattices, facilitating seamless communication and coordination among various nodes within the network.\n\nConfigurable privacy and data usage: Individual agencies must have the ability to define their privacy preferences and acceptable data usage policies, allowing the node to respect and adhere to these choices when executing computations and managing data.\n\nProtocol compatibility: The Plurigrid node should have the capacity to interact with numerous existing technologies and protocols, such as IBC, HTTP, gRPC, and HPC technologies, to create a broader scope of operability within the global technology landscape.\n\nAbility to mimic a chain: Although the Plurigrid mesh is not inherently a blockchain, it must be able to appear as one when connecting to platforms like Osmosis, allowing for seamless integration and interaction with existing systems.\n\nBy ensuring that the Plurigrid nodes are adaptable, respect user choices in terms of privacy, maintain interoperability with various technological standards, and can mimic conventional blockchain architectures when needed, the network positions itself as a highly efficient, decentralized, and self-organizing energy management platform capable of operating across different computational environments.\n\nJ\nAja: all of this is a lot for a microcontroller.

Although it might be technically challenging to accommodate the full functionality on such devices, it is not necessarily impossible.\n\nThere are ways to approach these limitations and enable Plurigrid to run on less powerful devices:\n\nSplit functionality: Rather than running the full set of modules and capabilities on a single microcontroller, you could potentially distribute the workload across multiple devices or components, taking advantage of the mesh network.\n\nOptimized communication stack: You could develop a lightweight version of the communication stack specifically for these devices, offering support for a subset of protocols that are most relevant to their context and capabilities.\n\nEdge computing: Leverage the distributed nature of the Plurigrid network to perform more computationally intensive tasks, such as AI model inference, on more powerful edge devices. The microcontroller could be responsible for data collection and local communication while offloading the heavier computations to nearby nodes in the network.\n\nModel quantization and pruning: Utilize techniques like model quantization or pruning to make AI models like LMs smaller and more efficient, making them suitable for running on microcontrollers with limited resources.\n\nIt is essential to recognize the trade-offs and limitations of working with constrained devices and adjust the system design accordingly. While it may not be feasible to run full-scale implementations of Plurigrid on microcontrollers, careful optimization and adaptation can enable successful deployment on a wide range of devices, including those with limited computational resources."},"selected":false,"positionAbsolute":{"x":145.71481679733702,"y":164.16047624009528},"dragging":false},{"width":150,"height":56,"id":"15725756611217334","position":{"x":143.96521723619674,"y":264.466123295093},"style":{"background":"#EEEEEE"},"data":{"label":"Today I derive plurigrid from ...","fluxNodeType":"User","text":"Today I derive plurigrid from first principles, plan my week, and plan and execute my day today"},"selected":false,"positionAbsolute":{"x":143.96521723619674,"y":264.466123295093},"dragging":false},{"width":150,"height":56,"id":"15634733067520923","position":{"x":-63,"y":710.7737958212798},"style":{"background":"#d9f3d6"},"data":{"label":"Plurigrid  First principles are ...","fluxNodeType":"GPT","text":"_Plurigrid_:\n\nFirst principles are fundamental truths that act as a foundation for reasoning and decision making.

Number of Agents**\n\nThe number of agents directly influences the computing resources needed for both training and inference. Larger numbers of agents require more computational capacity to execute the neural network policies simultaneously.\n\n**2. Neural Network Complexity**\n\nThe complexity of the neural networks used for policies affects the computational requirements.

Wind speed affects wind turbine output, and turbines generally have a specific cut-in wind speed (the wind speed at which they start generating power) and a rated wind speed (the wind speed at which they generate maximum power). You may want to use historical wind data, which can be obtained from local meteorological services, publicly accessible databases, or on-site measurements.\n\n3. **Capacity factor**: The capacity factor of a wind turbine is the ratio of actual energy output to the maximum possible energy output if the turbine were operating at full capacity all the time.

You can use publicly available data from meteorological sources, such as NASA or the World Bank, or utilize online resources like Global Wind Atlas. For this example, let's assume an average wind speed of 6 meters per second (m/s).\n\n3. **Wind Turbine Capacity Factor**: The capacity factor represents the efficiency of a wind turbine, which depends on the wind turbine type, local wind conditions, and altitude. Capacity factors can typically range from 20% to 45%.

For this example, let's assume a `1.5 MW` wind turbine. Keep in mind that larger wind turbines generate more energy but may not always be feasible for small communities.\n\nNow, calculate the annual energy generation per windmill:\n\n`Annual Energy Generation per Windmill (kWh) = Wind Turbine Size (kW) * Capacity Factor * Hours per Year`\n\nFor our example:\n\n`Annual Energy Generation per Windmill (kWh) = 1500 kW * 0.30 * 8760 (hours per year) = 3,942,000 kWh`\n\nNext, estimate the number of windmills needed to meet the community's energy demand:\n\n`Number of Windmills = Total Energy Demand (kWh) / Annual Energy Generation per Windmill (kWh)`\n\nApplying the values from our example:\n\n`Number of Windmills = 36,500 kWh / 3,942,000 kWh ≈ 0.00926`\n\nIn this case, a single 1.5 MW windmill can produce enough energy to meet the community's annual energy demand. However, it is important to account for seasonal wind flow, as it might affect the energy production throughout the year. To maintain a reliable power supply, you may consider installing a smaller additional windmill or combine it with another renewable energy source, such as solar panels, to compensate during periods of lower wind generation.\n\nKeep in mind that these calculations are simplified, and various factors like wind turbine installation and maintenance costs, grid interconnection costs, or environmental considerations need to be taken into account before deciding on the exact number and type of windmills.

The capacity factor depends on the wind resource at the location and usually varies between 20% and 40% for wind turbines.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of wind turbines needed**: Divide the community's annual energy requirement by the expected annual energy production per wind turbine. The result rounds up to the nearest whole number to ensure sufficient power generation.\n\nFor example, suppose a community requires 100,000 kWh of electricity annually, and the wind turbine model chosen has a rated power output of 100 kW. Assuming a capacity factor of 30%, the estimated annual energy production per turbine can be calculated as follows:\n\n`Annual Energy Production per Turbine (kWh) = Rated Power Output (kW) * Hours per Year * Capacity Factor = 100 kW * 8760 hours * 0.3 = 262,800 kWh`\n\nNext, divide the community's annual energy requirement by the annual energy production per turbine:\n\n`Number of Wind Turbines = Annual Energy Requirement (kWh) / Annual Energy Production per Turbine (kWh) = 100,000 kWh / 262,800 kWh ≈ 0.38`\n\nSince you cannot have a fraction of a wind turbine, round up to the nearest whole number:\n\n`Number of Wind Turbines = 1`\n\nIn this example, using just one 100 kW wind turbine would be sufficient to meet the community's annual energy demand, considering the geographical conditions and seasonal wind flow. It's important to note that this is a simplified example, and a more detailed analysis using site-specific data would be needed for an accurate estimation. Additionally, turbine placement, wind farm layout, and other factors should also be considered when planning a wind energy project."},"selected":false,"positionAbsolute":{"x":1136.3533766265557,"y":3922.9832064850634}},{"width":150,"height":56,"id":"9930596279354342","position":{"x":776.3533766265557,"y":4033.868903002776},"style":{"background":"#EEEEEE"},"data":{"label":"Based ooff of the mhigh growth ...","fluxNodeType":"User","text":"Based ooff of the mhigh growth numbers, pick a random location in somallia and calculate the number of windmills and the battery resources."},"selected":false,"positionAbsolute":{"x":776.3533766265557,"y":4033.868903002776}},{"width":150,"height":56,"id":"4160283658055637","position":{"x":596.3533766265557,"y":4146.919314022678},"style":{"background":"#d9f3d6"},"data":{"label":"In order to accurately ...","fluxNodeType":"GPT","text":"In order to accurately determine the number of windmills and battery resources needed for a randomly chosen location in Somalia, you would need access to historical and geographical data.

Based on publicly available research, the average wind speed in this region is approximately 6.5 m/s.\n\nAssuming a high growth scenario, the annual energy consumption was estimated at 547.5 kWh.\n\n1. **Number of windmills**: Let's consider using 10 kW wind turbines with a capacity factor of 30%, which is typical for onshore wind turbines.\n\n   Annual energy production per turbine = Turbine capacity * capacity factor * hours per year\n   = 10 kW * 0.3 * 8760 hours = 26,280 kWh\n\n   Number of wind turbines = Total energy consumption / annual energy production per turbine\n   = 547.5 kWh / 26,280 kWh ≈ 0.021 turbines\n\n   Given this energy demand estimate, one 10 kW wind turbine would be more than sufficient to meet the annual energy requirements. Keep in mind that these calculations are based on several assumptions, and actual energy consumption and generation could differ significantly.\n\n2. **Battery resources**: Energy storage requirements depend on various factors, including the intermittent nature of wind, daily and seasonal fluctuations in energy demand, and desired reliability levels.

The high growth scenario resulted in an estimated 547.5 kWh annual energy consumption related to the MARL setup in households.\n2. An onshore wind turbine with a capacity of 2 MW and a capacity factor of 30%.\n3. The average daily energy demand is 547.5 kWh / 365 days ≈ 1.5 kWh per day.\n\nFirst, let's estimate the daily energy production from a single 2 MW wind turbine:\n\nDaily energy (kWh) = Turbine capacity (kW) × Hours per day × Capacity factor\n                   = 2000 kW × 24 h × 0.30\n                   = 14,400 kWh\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of wind turbines needed:\n\nNumber of wind turbines = Daily energy demand / Daily energy production per turbine\n                        = 1.5 kWh / 14,400 kWh\n                        ≈ 0.0001\n\nSince the energy demand related to the MARL setup is minimal compared to the energy output of a 2 MW wind turbine, a single wind turbine would be more than enough to satisfy the demand.\n\nFor battery resources, you need to consider:\n\n1. Autonomy days: The number of days the battery system can supply energy without recharging, typically 1-3 days for grid-connected systems and 3-5 days for off-grid systems.\n2. Depth of discharge (DoD): The percentage of a battery's capacity that can be used without compromising the battery's lifespan. For example, a lithium-ion battery typically has a DoD of 80-90%.\n\nAssuming 3 days of autonomy and a DoD of 90% for the battery:\n\nBattery capacity = (Daily energy demand × Autonomy days) / DoD\n                 = (1.5 kWh × 3 days) / 0.90\n                 ≈ 5 kWh\n\nTo satisfy the high growth scenario's energy requirements, you would need one 2 MW wind turbine and a battery storage system with a capacity of 5 kWh.

For this example, we will use Hargeisa, which is one of the largest cities in Somalia. You can replace this with any other desired location.\n\n2. **Wind resource**: Based on historical wind data from global databases such as the Global Wind Atlas or ERA5, let's assume an average annual wind speed of 6 m/s at 80 meters hub height in Hargeisa.\n\n3. **Wind turbine**: Let's assume we will use a small-scale wind turbine with a capacity of 10 kW and a capacity factor of 25% given the average wind speed. This means that the actual average output of the wind turbine would be 2.5 kW (10 kW * 0.25).\n\n4. **Energy demand**: According to the high growth scenario, the annual energy demand related to the MARL setup is 547.5 kWh. To accommodate for other household electricity requirements, we assume an additional 60,000 kWh per year, which brings the total annual energy demand to 60,547.5 kWh.\n\n5. **Number of windmills**: To calculate the number of windmills required to cover the demand, divide the total annual energy demand by the product of the turbine's output and the number of hours in a year:\n\n   Number of windmills = Total annual energy demand / (Turbine output * hours/year)\n   Number of windmills = 60,547.5 kWh / (2.5 kW * 8760 hr) ≈ 2.75\n\nBased on this calculation, you would need 3 wind turbines of the assumed capacity to cover the annual energy demand.\n\n6. **Battery storage**: To size the battery storage, you need to estimate the expected energy variability and select a storage capacity that can cover energy demand during periods of low wind. We can assume that the battery storage should be able to supply power for 2 days during low wind periods:\n\n   Battery capacity = Daily average energy demand * Number of days\n   Battery capacity = (60,547.5 kWh / 365 days) * 2 ≈ 331.5 kWh\n\nIn this example, you would require a battery storage system with a capacity of about 331.5 kWh to cover energy demand during periods of low wind.\n\nPlease note that these calculations and assumptions are for illustration purposes only.
