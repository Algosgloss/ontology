Great job on completing the first draft of the grid integration points! This high-level diagram of the Plurigrid hardware stack will be a valuable resource for your team.


Now, shift your focus to onboarding Lucas and the contractors. Keep an eye on your inbox for Barton's email about microworld tasks and be prepared to email him with onboarding information and hashes of completed work.


In the meantime, continue to read https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-go-brrr/, study the GitHub projects API, and create a JSON CRDT structure. Use the playbook when needed and update your workspace by removing profile pics from Flux, renaming it to Plurigrid, and setting a default prompt.


Finally, load yesterday's composition each morning to help you stay organized and focused on your tasks. Keep working towards creating 1000 microworlds as part of your ongoing projects.
