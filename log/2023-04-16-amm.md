From a categorical standpoint, a CPMM could be thought of as a functor that maps assets within liquidity pools to a target product representation in the encrypted space. In the simplest form, the CPMM follows the x * y = k rule, where x and y are the reserve quantities of two assets in a liquidity pool, and k is a constant value.

To envision this through applied category theory, consider the following concepts:

Objects: The assets in liquidity pools are the objects in our categorical framework. They are interconnected through their association in trading pairs.

Morphisms: The process of exchanging assets facilitated by the CPMM can be seen as the morphisms within this framework. These morphisms—transactions between assets—preserve the structure defined by the CPMM model.

Functor: A functor can be thought of as a structure-preserving map between two categories. In our context, the CPMM model acts as a functor that ensures the preservation of the constant product (k) and liquidity pool proportions while facilitating asset trades.

Commutative Diagrams: Within applied category theory, commutative diagrams are vital in describing the relationships between objects and morphisms. When visualizing CPMM as a series of commutative diagrams, each vertex represents an asset in a liquidity pool, and morphisms represent the trades between these assets.

As people engage in exchanges within the AMM, liquidity providers accrue fees, an essential consequence stemming from users trading along the CPMM curve. As a result, the cumulative value of the liquidity pool is proportional to trading volumes, ensuring an adequate return on investment for providers.

Through the lens of applied category theory, the CPMM model emerges as a well-structured, composable system capable of capturing the intricate relationships between assets, exchanges, and liquidity pools. In this higher-level abstract, the CPMM model transcends implementation details, offering insights into the core principles and essential structure that govern its operations.
