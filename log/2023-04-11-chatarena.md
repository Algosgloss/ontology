first goal: to finish constructing our feedback loop using chat arena, because it's faster and easier to demonstrate with 

by demo day, we won’t necessarily have to have smart contracts even, more message passing between agents running on hardware — a demonstration of the open game  

-   chat arena: 3-6 players, using multiple strategy profiles, to collaborate and take actions 
-   zulip and chatorg archives — llama-index will have to be used 
-   and also, these archives will later be used for RLHF for formal specification of grid configurations
