- scope of work has three topics
- *CRDT* a data structure that can be updated by multiple hosts and then merged to GitHub
- `just map` can either continuosly update the starmap rendering or it can just update when run
- Bartons y-py work is in a replit project
- If free time look into running alien on jetson in VR

reward function:
1: starmap reflects the `y-py` CRDT or obtainable with at most 1 minute latency by running `just map` in a way that does not deviate from the furthest state of CRDT at the time

arena:
A. finish the scope of work for the individual contributors and persist it in an interoperable format (e.g. json, xml, yaml, etc)
B. store the items into the CRDT (y-py or y-rs) and periodically sync to github
C. render the items from the CRDT into a starmap

Rendered as an ASCII DAG:
A ---> B ---> C

Rendered

If you need to procrastinate actually important
- run

Have a version of the from GitHub data BUT originating with CRDT on one of the hosts that can push to the repo.
