Here are three different hardware node configurations for the Plurigrid Nexus, with ASCII diagrams showing the arrangement and function of each node. Each configuration represents a distinct level of complexity and capability for managing energy resources.

Configuration 1: Residential Node
```

        +--------------+
        | Smart Meter  |
        +-------+------+
                |
                |
        +-------v------+
        | Plurigrid    | <-----+ Solar Panels
        | Residential  |        + Home Batteries
        | Node (Edge)  |        + Electric Vehicle Chargers
        +--------------+        + IoT Devices
```
In this configuration, the residential node communicates with the smart meter and integrates with various home energy resources such as solar panels, home batteries, electric vehicle chargers, and IoT devices. This node manages energy consumption and generation data and engages in decentralized energy trading and demand-response events.

Configuration 2: Commercial Node

    +-----------------+
    | Building Energy |  +--+ Rooftop Solar
    | Management      |  +--+ Energy Storage System
    | System (BEMS)   +------
    +--------+--------+  +--+ HVAC Systems
             |           +--+ Lighting Systems
             |           +--+ EV Charging Stations
    +--------v--------+
    | Plurigrid       <-----+ Grid Connection
    | Commercial      |
    | Node (Edge)     |
    +-----------------+
```
This commercial node is connected to a building energy management system (BEMS) and various energy resources such as rooftop solar generation, energy storage systems, HVAC, lighting systems, and electric vehicle charging stations. This node is responsible for efficient energy management and participates in energy trading and demand-response programs with other nodes.

Configuration 3: Data Center Node
```
+--------------------+
| Data Center (HPC)  | <-----+ Cooling Systems
+---------+----------+        + Backup Generators
          |
          |
+---------v----------+
| Plurigrid          |
| Data Center        | <-----+ Grid Connection
| Node (Edge/GPU)    |
+--------------------+
```
This data center node is designed to manage high-performance computing (HPC) operations and communicates with associated energy resources, such as cooling systems and backup generators. This node ensures energy efficiency, processes real-time analytics, and participates in more complex energy trading and management scenarios.

The Plurigrid network arranges these nodes in a layered structure based on their roles and capabilities.

Minimalistic ASCII diagrams:

Configuration 1: Nexus in Residential Setting

Configuration 2: Nexus in Commercial Setting
```
  +---+
  | C |
  +---+
```
Configuration 3: Nexus in Data Center
```
  +---+
  | D |
  +---+
```
These nodes communicate with each other and central management systems to exchange data, engage in secure energy trading, make collaborative decisions, and maintain energy infrastructure. The integration of MPC and secure distributed dataflow frameworks such as Moose provides privacy, security, and collaborative decision-making for the Plurigrid Nexus platform.
