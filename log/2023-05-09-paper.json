INTRODUCTION\nL\nARGE-SCALE modeling of the U.S. energy system\ntypically finds that low-cost approaches to decarbonization include a significant role for wind and solar resources\nsupported by substantial expansion of transmission infrastructure [1]–[3]. In U.S. systems, however, existing processes\nfor transmission planning have not led to expansion on the\nscale predicted to be beneficial by models that co-optimize\ntransmission and generation. Several factors may help explain\nthis disconnect, including conflicts between Federal and State\nregulatory authorities contributing to difficulties siting and\npermitting new lines [4], the efforts of incumbent generators\nto retain market power in their area [5], and a lack of coordination between neighboring system operators [6]. Among the\npotential contributing factors, this article focuses on the lack of\ncoordination between generation and transmission investment\nwithin the territory of a single liberalized market.\nWhile coordinating between centralized transmission planning and decentralized generation investment has always been\na challenge in liberalized electricity markets [7]–[11], the\nproblem has grown in recent years with increasing investor\ninterest in wind and solar generation [12]. At the end of 2022,\nJ. Mays is with the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Cornell\nUniversity, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA e-mail: jacobmays@cornell.edu.\ninterconnection queues for systems covering approximately 85\npercent of U.S. consumption held over 2,000 GW of capacity,\na quantity well above the amount currently operational in those\nsystems. Solar, wind, and storage represent approximately 95\npercent of the total [13]. Correspondingly, projects hoping to\nconnect to the system have reported delays in interconnection,\nbringing uncertainty and additional cost [14]. In a negative\nfeedback loop, uncertainty and delays have led project developers to submit a larger number of more speculative interconnection requests in the hopes of identifying a favorable project\nsize and location. This larger number of requests prompts\nadditional interconnection studies, leading to further delays\nin the process. From an engineering perspective, the goal of\nthe interconnection study process is to anticipate potential\nreliability problems in advance before a new generator is\nallowed to enter the market. From an economic perspective,\nhowever, long delays and cost uncertainty contravene the\nfree entry assumption of competitive markets, i.e., that new\nproducers are able to sell goods without undue barriers to\nentry.\nA. Context and Related Literature\nThis paper considers the economic and cost allocation implications of two competing approaches to the interconnection\nat the transmission level, the names of which derive from the\ngrid access reforms implemented in 2010 in the U.K. [15].\nIn U.S. systems apart from the Electric Reliability Council\nof Texas (ERCOT), network upgrades can be divided into\nthree categories: those driven by local reliability needs, those\ndetermined as part of a centralized planning process, and\nthose prompted by generator interconnection requests [6].\nThe presence of upgrades in the third category reflects the\n“invest and connect” approach to interconnection. Since these\nupgrades are myopic and geared to particular generators (or\nsmall clusters of generators), subsuming this category into\nthe second could lead to more efficient network expansion\ndecisions overall. The example of ERCOT, which follows\na “connect and manage” approach with substantially shorter\nqueue times than other U.S. systems [16], shows that the third\ncategory is not strictly necessary from a reliability perspective.\nSimply eliminating the third category of upgrades, however,\nraises two issues. First, one goal of transmission cost allocation\nis to encourage entrants to connect at favorable locations in\nthe network (e.g., near load centers). Typical practice in the\nU.S. is to allocate the cost of upgrades in the third category\nto interconnecting generators and the cost of those in the\nsecond category to loads in one or more zones that benefit\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Energy Markets, Policy, and Regulation.

A change in processes would therefore\nalter the overall cost allocation, with potential implications for\nthe efficiency of generator siting decisions [17]–[19]. Second,\nin order for the centralized process to lead to an efficient expansion, planners must have a plausible view of the generation\ninvestment decisions that will arise as a result of the chosen\ntransmission configuration [20]–[24]. This requirement is in\ntension with a core rationale of competitive markets: central\nplanners may not have an accurate view of the future costs\nand actions of potential entrants to the market. At present,\ncentralized planning processes include only generators that\nhave a signed generator interconnection agreement, implying\nthat they have already moved through the interconnection\nprocess [6]. As a result, generation and transmission expansion\ndecisions proceed in a largely myopic and sequential manner,\npotentially missing large opportunities that might be found\nwith co-optimization [25]–[27]. A change in processes could\nalter the information about future generation additions available to planners, with potential implications for the quality of\nthe resulting transmission plan.\nCurrent processes violate principles of cost allocation in\nthree ways. First, systems nominally follow the principle that\nbeneficiaries of the transmission system should pay in rough\nproportion to the benefits they receive [28]. Since network\nupgrades prompted by generator interconnection potentially\nbenefit all current and future users of the network, it is unlikely\nthat allocating cost to interconnecting generators conforms to\nthis principle [29]. Second, since generators cannot change\ntheir location once constructed, it is desirable that network\ntransmission charges be determined ex ante [30], [31]. As\npreviously mentioned, prospective generators have little way to\ndetermine costs upon entering interconnection queues. Further,\nin markets with nodal pricing, such as those in the U.S.,\na portion of the total cost of transmission is implicit in\nlocational prices seen by market participants. In this context,\nuncertainty in congestion costs over a project’s life amounts\nto a failure to allocate costs ex ante. While in theory financial\ntransmission rights (FTRs) could be used to convert uncertain\ncongestion costs into a stable transmission charge [32], [33],\nthere is at present no evidence that FTRs have been used to\nsupport project finance [34]. More generally, FTR markets\nin the U.S. have encountered a number of problems since\ntheir inception, leading many to question whether they are\naccomplishing their stated aims [35]. Along these lines, while\nnodal markets provide superior incentives for generation siting\nin expectation [17], [36], their performance depends on the\nability of market participants to effectively manage congestion\nrisk [37], [38]. The issue of liquidity in these hedging markets\nfeatures prominently in debates about moving from a zonal to\na nodal design in Europe. Third, efficiency suggests that on\nthe margin, costs should be assigned to those in a position to\ncontrol them [39], [40]. In the transmission context, generators\nhave limited ability to influence either the initial cost of\nnetwork upgrades or the ongoing cost of congestion. Instead,\nthese costs are governed by decisions made by transmission\nowners and system planners with no direct financial stake in\nthe outcome. In situations where transmission owners also\nown generation assets, the financial incentives may in fact\npush in the opposite direction: given the discretion incumbent\ntransmission owners have in planning processes, they may\npreferentially promote network upgrades that benefit affiliated\ngenerators.\nWhile similar issues affect the interconnection of resources\nat the distribution level, the lack of economic dispatch and\nnodal prices in that context creates different challenges for\ncost allocation. Accordingly, this paper limits the discussion\nto the transmission level."

Proposed Reforms\n\nTo address the issues discussed in the previous section, this paper proposes a shift from the current \"invest and connect\" approach to a \"connect and manage\" approach for generator interconnection in the US electricity markets. This reform entails the following changes:\n\n1. Eliminate the third category of network upgrades prompted by generator interconnection requests, and include these upgrades in the centralized planning process. This change will help improve the efficiency of network expansion decisions.\n\n2. Introduce a new financial right connected with transmission service, which allows generators to trade uncertain network upgrade and congestion costs for a fixed interconnection fee. This change will improve the ex-ante cost allocation for generators and provide better incentives for efficient generator siting.\n\n3.

Simulation\n\nThe proposed reforms are tested using a stylized two-node system to demonstrate their potential to facilitate a transition to clean technologies. The simulation results show that the \"connect and manage\" approach can effectively address the issues related to inefficient coordination between generation and transmission investment and promote the integration of renewable resources.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, this paper highlights the challenges of coordinating decentralized generation investment and centralized transmission planning in liberalized electricity markets, particularly in the context of rapid decarbonization. The proposed shift to a \"connect and manage\" approach and the introduction of a new financial right connected with transmission service can help resolve the issues related to inefficient interconnection of new resources, resource adequacy, and incumbent generator protection.

        "text": "In summary, the paper addresses the inefficient coordination between decentralized generation investment and centralized transmission planning in liberalized electricity markets, which acts as a barrier to rapid decarbonization. The author identifies a negative feedback loop that prevents efficient interconnection of new resources in U.S. markets, links it to conceptual flaws in current resource adequacy constructs, and discusses how it protects incumbent generators. The paper recommends a shift to a \"connect and manage\" approach and proposes a new financial right connected with transmission service. The goal is to improve the quality of information about new generation included in forward-looking planning processes and facilitate a transition to clean technologies."

The economics of using a flat rate can be explained through the following points:\n\n1. Predictability: A flat rate provides certainty and predictability for power generators regarding the cost of connecting to the grid. This allows them to make better-informed decisions about their investments and reduces the risk of unexpected costs related to grid upgrades and congestion.\n\n2. Simplicity: Charging a flat rate simplifies the interconnection process by eliminating the need for complex calculations and negotiations related to grid upgrade costs and congestion charges. This can reduce administrative burdens and make the overall process more efficient.\n\n3. Fairness: A flat rate ensures that all power generators pay the same fee for connecting to the grid, regardless of their size, technology, or location. This creates a level playing field and prevents potential discrimination against certain types of generators.\n\n4. Incentives for efficient siting: While flat rates provide predictability, they should be designed in a way that encourages power generators to locate their facilities in areas where they will have the least impact on the grid and cause the least amount of congestion. This can be achieved by adjusting the flat rate based on factors such as proximity to load centers or existing transmission infrastructure.\n\n5. Revenue for transmission planners: The flat rate interconnection fees collected from power generators can be used by transmission planners to fund grid expansion and maintenance projects.

While the exact method for calculating the rate might vary depending on the specific market or regulatory context, here are some general steps that could be followed:\n\n1. Determine the base cost: The base cost represents the average cost of connecting a power generator to the grid. This can be calculated by analyzing historical data on interconnection costs and grid upgrades, taking into account the costs of materials, labor, and other associated expenses.\n\n2. Factor in location-specific costs: Location-specific costs account for differences in the costs of connecting generators in different areas. These costs can vary depending on factors such as the distance to existing transmission infrastructure, the complexity of the terrain, and the availability of suitable sites for new generators. To account for these factors, the base cost can be adjusted using location-specific multipliers or adders.\n\n3. Consider congestion and network impact: The flat rate should also take into account the potential impact of a new generator on the transmission grid, particularly in terms of congestion. This can be done by assessing the generator's proximity to load centers, the existing capacity of the transmission lines, and the expected growth in electricity demand in the area. Generators that are expected to have a lower impact on the grid may be eligible for a lower flat rate, while those with a higher impact may be charged a higher rate.\n\n4. Include regulatory and policy factors: The flat rate calculation may need to account for any regulatory or policy requirements, such as incentives for renewable energy generation or requirements for grid reliability and resilience. These factors can be incorporated through adjustments to the base cost or the location-specific factors.\n\n5. Calculate the final flat rate: Once all the relevant factors have been accounted for, the final flat rate interconnection fee can be determined. This rate should be transparent, predictable, and fair for all power generators, regardless of their size, technology, or location.\n\nIt is important to note that the methodology for calculating and adjusting the flat rate should be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure it remains accurate and relevant in the face of changing market conditions, technological advancements, and policy priorities."

While the exact methodology may differ depending on the specific system and regulatory context, some general principles can guide the rate calculation and adjustment:\n\n1. Cost recovery: The flat rate should be set at a level that allows transmission planners to recover the costs associated with connecting new power generators to the grid, including grid upgrades, maintenance, and expansion projects.\n\n2. Cost causation: The rate should reflect the costs that each generator imposes on the system due to its location, technology, and size. This can be achieved by considering factors such as the distance to existing transmission infrastructure, the expected level of congestion, and the capacity of the generator.\n\n3. Incentives for efficient siting: To encourage power generators to locate their facilities in areas with the least impact on the grid, the flat rate can be adjusted based on location-specific factors. For example, generators located closer to load centers or existing transmission lines might pay a lower flat rate compared to those located in more remote areas with higher grid connection costs.\n\n4.

Generation and Transmission Co-optimization\nThe joint generation and transmission expansion problem is\nformulated as a deterministic linear program that maximizes\nthe total surplus over the course of one year of operations\nafter accounting for an annualized investment cost for both\ngeneration and transmission. Power flow is simplified to a\ntransportation model. Reflecting the declining average costs\ntypical of transmission infrastructure, transmission cost consists of fixed and size-dependent components. While this cost\nstructure generally necessitates a mixed-integer program, we\nmake the assumption that it is always optimal to build some\namount of transmission in the included corridors in the range\nof costs considered, allowing a simplification to the linear\nmodel.\nThe joint generation and transmission expansion problem is\nstated as follows:\n(CEP)\nmaximize\nx,y,z,f,d\nP\ni∈N\nP\nt∈T B(dit − Dit) −\nP\nt∈T\nP\ng∈G C\nEN\ng\nygt\n−\nX\ng∈G\nC\nINV\ng xg −\nX\nl∈L\n(KF\nl + KV\nl\nzl) (1a)\nsubject to\ndit −\nX\ng∈Gi\nygt +\nX\nl∈L\nSilflt = 0 ∀i ∈ N , t ∈ T (1b)\n− zl ≤ flt ≤ zl ∀l ∈ L, t ∈ T (1c)\n0 ≤ ygt ≤ Agtxg ∀g ∈ G, t ∈ T (1d)\n0 ≤ dit ≤ Dit ∀i ∈ N , t ∈ T (1e)\nxg ≥ 0 ∀g ∈ G (1f)\nzl ≥ 0 ∀l ∈ L. (1g)\nWhile formulated as a maximization problem, constants reflecting the value of firm demand and the fixed component of\ntransmission cost are included, allowing the objective function\nin Eq. (1a) to be interpreted as the negative total cost to build\nand operate the system, including the cost of shedding load\nwhen necessary. With the node-arc incidence matrix element\nSil taking the value 1 for a line originating at i, -1 for a line\nterminating at i, and 0 otherwise, Eq. (1b) represents power\nbalance at each node. Equation (1c) enforces maximum flow\non each line in each period, while Eq. (1d) limits generation to\nits available capacity in each period. Lastly, Eq. (1e) constrains\nthe quantity of served load.\nB. Myopic Investment\nIn the myopic case, investors in generation expand capacity\nto an optimal quantity based on the current transmission\ncapacity in the system, while the transmission system planner\nbuilds based on the current generation capacity. Both processes\nare modeled as deterministic linear programs, and the order\nis chosen such that within each cycle generation investment\noccurs before transmission. With z\nk\nl\nrepresenting the capacity\nof line l at the end of investment cycle k ∈ K, the generation\nexpansion problem for cycle k + 1 is stated as follows:\n(GEP)\nmaximize\nx,y,f,d\nX\ni∈N\nX\nt∈T\nB(dit − Dit)\n−\nX\nt∈T\nX\ng∈G\nC\nEN\ng\nygt −\nX\ng∈G\nC\nINV\ng xg (2a)\nsubject to (1b), (1d)–(1f)\n−z\nk\nl ≤ flt ≤ z\nk\nl ∀l ∈ L, t ∈ T .\n(2b)\nWith x\nk\ng\nrepresenting the installed capacity of technology g\nin cycle k, the transmission expansion problem in cycle k is\nstated as follows:\n(T EP)\nmaximize\ny,z,f,d\nX\ni∈N\nX\nt∈T\nB(dit − Dit)\n−\nX\nt∈T\nX\ng∈G\nC\nEN\ng\nygt\n−\nX\nl∈L\n(KF\nl + KV\nl\nzl) (3a)\nsubject to (1b), (1c), (1e), (1g)\n0 ≤ ygt ≤ Agtx\nk\ng ∀g ∈ G, t ∈ T .

Copper Plate Model\nIn the numerical example, the proposed FIR is settled\nagainst the price that would arise in a copper plate system,\ni.e., one without transmission constraints. The copper plate\ndispatch problem given generation capacity xˆ is stated as\nfollows:\n(CU − ED)\nmaximize\ny,d\nX\ni∈N\nX\nt∈T\nB(dit − Dit)\n−\nX\nt∈T\nX\ng∈G\nC\nEN\ng\nygt (5a)\nsubject to X\ni∈N\ndit −\nX\ng∈G\nygt = 0 ∀t ∈ T (5b)\n0 ≤ ygt ≤ Agtxˆg ∀g ∈ G, t ∈ T (5c)\n0 ≤ dit ≤ Dit ∀i ∈ N , t ∈ T . (5d)\nE. Financial Interconnection Rights\nAs defined in this paper, a generator that holds a FIR has an\noption on the difference between the price that would arise in a\ncopper plate model and the spot price at their location, with the\nvolume scaled by the availability of that generator. Along the\nlines of the discussion in [55], this definition is appropriate for\nthe variable renewables driving current issues in interconnection processes; however, alternative definitions of the hedging\ninstrument could be constructed for thermal resources, storage,\nand demand-side resources as appropriate. Letλit indicate the\nprice at node i in time period t, calculated as the dual variable\nto the power balance constraint in model (ED), and let λ\nCU\nt\nindicate the dual variable to the power balance constraint in\nthe copper plate model (CU−ED). Then, the per-MW payout\nrg of a FIR for generator g located at node i is calculated as\nrg =\nX\nt∈T\nAgt max{0, λCU\nt − λit}. (6)\nNote that the volume of the contract is determined by the\navailability of the resource, rather than the amount actually\nproduced in real-time given a potentially suboptimal generation mix or transmission configuration. Accordingly, the\ncontract does not affect dispatch incentives on the margin. For\nthe numerical experiment, the price qg of the instrument per\nMW of installed capacity (i.e., the fixed interconnection fee)\nis calculated as\nqg =\nX\nt∈T\nAgt max{0, λCU∗\nt − λ\n∗\nit}, (7)\nwhere values for λ\n∗\nit are calculated as the dual variables to\nEq. (1b) from model (CEP) and those for λ\nCU∗\nt\nare calculated using model (CU −ED) and the optimal generation mix\nfrom model (CEP). It follows that, with perfect information\nand an optimally configured generation mix and transmission\nsystem, the price and payout of the contract would be precisely\nequal.\nIt is worth highlighting that the definition here relies on the\npresence of full-strength nodal prices for energy. In a system\nwith zonal capacity markets, the hedge would also need to\ninclude the financial component of a CIR. While a CIR grants\nthe right to participate in the capacity market (based on a\ndeliverability assessment performed upon interconnection), an\nFIR would provide a swap on revenues in the capacity market\neven if a unit were deemed non-deliverable in a later, more\naccurate assessment.\nF. Equilibrium Generation Mix\nA long-run competitive equilibrium generation mix for a\ngiven transmission configuration occurs when a) spot prices\nmatch supply and demand at each node in each time period,\ni.e., the short-term market clears, and b) each generation\nresource with non-zero capacity in the system achieves zero\nprofit. Suppose (x\n∗\n, y∗\n, z∗\n, f ∗\n, d∗\n) is an optimal solution to\nmodel (CEP). Then, given the linear programming form of\nmodel (CEP), it is well-known that x\n∗\nis an equilibrium generation mix. Now consider a modified copper-plate generation\nexpansion problem formulated as follows:\n(CU − GEP)\nmaximize\nx,y,d\nP\ni∈N\nP\nt∈T B(dit − Dit) −\nP\nt∈T\nP\ng∈G C\nEN\ng\nygt\n−\nX\ng∈G\n(C\nINV\ng + qg)xg (8a)\nsubject to\nX\ni∈N\ndit −\nX\ng∈G\nygt = 0 ∀t ∈ T (8b)\n0 ≤ ygt ≤ Agtxg ∀g ∈ G, t ∈ T (8c)\n0 ≤ dit ≤ Dit ∀i ∈ N , t ∈ T . (8d)\nComparing to model (GEP), the investment cost C\nINV\ng has\nbeen adjusted by the cost of the FIR, qg, and transmission\nconstraints have been relaxed. As a linear program, prices\nequal to the dual variables associated with Eq. (8b) lead\nto zero profit for all generators in the optimal solution to\nmodel (CU − GEP). Assuming the FIR achieves its goal of\nexchanging operating profits under nodal prices for operating\nprofits that would be obtained in a copper-plate system, payouts from the contract precisely balance the additional charge\nqg, implying that x\n∗\nis also a zero-profit equilibrium under\nthe proposed regime. As a consequence, model (CU −GEP)\ncan be solved to find the equilibrium generation mix that\nwould be obtained with FIRs, and (neglecting complications\nwith multiple optimal primal or dual solutions) this generation\nmix is socially optimal for the socially optimal transmission\nsystem."

        "text": "In recent years, the integration of low-carbon resources, such as renewable energy sources, into power systems has become increasingly important for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. However, this transition also brings new technical challenges in maintaining the security of power systems. In this paper, Billimoria, Mancarella, and Poudineh explore the relationship between the physical and economic aspects of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nThe authors propose a physics-informed approach to classify power system security products and services, revealing two critical findings. Firstly, they demonstrate that these services should not be considered as a homogeneous set of public goods, but rather as a set of products/services (basket of goods) with both public and private characteristics. This distinction is important because it has implications for the design of market and regulatory frameworks that govern the provision and consumption of these services.\n\nSecondly, the framework suggests that many new system services can be characterized as common pool resources. This means that they are shared resources that are available to multiple users, but their use by one individual may deplete the availability of the resource for others. As a result, there is a need for more localized network planning and coordination of access and service provision to efficiently manage these resources.\n\nThe paper highlights the importance of considering both the physical and economic dimensions of power system security when designing market and regulatory frameworks for low-carbon electricity systems. This can help ensure that the transition to cleaner energy sources does not compromise the reliability and security of power grids, while also promoting efficient allocation of resources and minimizing costs for consumers.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of low-carbon resources into power systems requires a rethinking of the way security products and services are classified and managed. By considering both the physical and economic aspects of power system security, policy-makers and regulators can design more effective frameworks that promote the efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems."

That is, in our case,\nhow is power system security appropriated and who are\nthe appropriators?\nA helpful analogy is to think of power system security\nas analogous to water quality [17]. As described in the\nvalue chain, ESS provides a secure physical system\nenvelope within which the generation and consumption\nof energy can occur. As such all power system users,\nboth generators and consumers, are consumers of the\nrelevant services essential for system security (ESS),\nas all benefit from a stable grid that facilitates trade\nin energy. Generators also directly benefit from system\nsecurity, as an insecure and unstable grid could result in\nmore frequent unit tripping and equipment damage [44].\nTherefore, as Cowen [11] describes in the context of club\ngoods, we can say that ‘an additional membership would\nreally amount to an additional consumption unit’. As the\nbeneficiaries of operational security are quite diverse,\nthis means it can be more difficult in determining\nhow much a new user affects operational security. For\nexample, a new user could be one that contributes to\nor detracts from system security depending upon the\nspecific technology and control system used. Thankfully,\nthis is a challenge not unique to electricity, and one\npossible approach is to determine whether there are\nclasses of users more likely connect in a certain area\n[17, 50] (e.g. wind and solar tend have tended locate in\nmore remote and weaker parts of the grid).\nStep 2: excludability\nThe characteristic of excludability is analysed in the second stage. Can a system service be physically excluded\nfrom a user? For many system services, users cannot be\nnaturally excluded from enjoying the value of the services in a power system. For example, all resources benefit from frequency and voltage stability in the system\n[43, 54]. Alternately, if a user can be curtailed (such as,\ne.g. with products allowing for differentiated reliability),\nthen the service can be considered excludable.\nStep 3: subtractability and jointness of use\nThe third step involves an assessment of subtractability.\nThe marginal cost of extension is an applicable concept for assessing subtractability, defined as the cost\nof extending a good or service to a new beneficiary or\nuser [50]. Goods that are subtractable by definition will\nhave a positive marginal cost of extension. Most goods\nare somewhat subtractable [21, 54]. The policy question\nis, ‘Is it significant enough to reframe the allocation of\nproperty rights?’ Note S1 sets out the formulation for\nthe assessment of subtractability for a variety of ESS by\nexamining the impact on the marginal cost of extension.\nStep 4: transformation\nIn the final stage, we consider the potential for transformation of the service.

Illustrative system for system strength characterization analysis, involving a PEC resource connected via an infinite bus to synchronous\nresources\ntime and region and ref lecting the system of property\nrights currently in place. Transformation of goods can\noccur based on the framework of laws and regulation\nin place, and any market frameworks [10]. For example, in the NEM, new regulations for system strength\nintroduce requirements for grid-following PEC resources\nto contribute to system strength network augmentation via connection charges, which reduce the degree\nof subtractability of the service [1]. Policy makers need\nto consider the impact of existing and proposed policy\nframeworks on economic characterization.\nRESULTS\nCASE STUDY: SYSTEM STRENGTH AND\nFAULT LEVELS IN WEAK GRIDS\nSystem strength is an emerging challenge in regions\nwith high inverter-based penetration. For a weak grid,\nthe voltage exhibits sensitivity to variation in active or\nreactive power [19]. Strong grids have stiff voltages which\nare resilient to disturbances. The strength of the system\nis an outcome of various factors, but historically synchronous units have been a strong contributor to system\nstrength. The first generation of PEC resources (using\nphase-locked loop controls) requires a strong grid to\noperate and have small contributions to system strength\n[19], thereby requiring contributions from online synchronous generators [27]. New advanced ‘grid forming’\ninverter technology can allow inverter-based resources to\nmeaningfully contribute to system strength. Weak grids\nare susceptible to instability and can result in failure of\nfault-protection and inverter control systems [19], voltage oscillations [40] and angular instability [52].\nStatic and quasi-static metrics provide high-level\nscreening for system strength impacts, including variations on the classical short circuit ratio and the available\nfault level (AFL) [2, 9]. Small-signal analysis methods\nare also an increasingly common approach. System\noperators are also increasingly undertaking computationally intensive electromagnetic transient simulations\nto understand what combinations of resources create\nstrong or weak grids [9].\nShort-term but less undesirable fixes to managing system strength issues have involved out of merit dispatch\nof synchronous generation. Network augmentation of\nsynchronous condensers [19, 45] and inverter tuning are\nlonger term alternatives, along with the increased piloting and deployment of grid-forming inverters [27].\nIn providing a conceptual understanding of the\neconomic characterization of system strength, we focus\nupon fault level as the key factor and use the associated\nmetric of AFL at a node [9]. However, it should be noted\nthis represents a simplification of a highly dynamic,\ncomplex and evolving system phenomena. As such, this\nexample is not intended to reveal a final characterization\nbut an indication of the key sensitivities. As AFL has been\nconsidered and implemented as a high-level planning\nmetric in certain markets [19] and is widely used in\ntechnical analysis [9], we gain a degree of comfort that its\nuse here conveys a reasonable conceptual understanding\nof the dynamic phenomena. However, a system dynamics\nanalysis would be required case by case to understand\nthe true physical interactions of different factors. A\ndynamics analysis could then be readily coupled with\nstatic metrics as an extension to this formulation as part\nof future work.\nIn this case, we consider an example adapted from\nCIGRE [9], shown in Fig. 3, showing the connection of\na PEC resource such as a wind farm to an infinite bus.\nFault level contributions are provided by synchronous\nresources within the infinite bus. Under the original\nCIGRE analysis, a synchronous unit is assumed able to\nprovide the full system strength contribution (in terms\nof fault current) that was required.\nThe AFL at the connection point is calculated as the\ndifference between the fault level provided by the synchronous resources and the fault level required by the\nPEC resource.\nAFL = Fprov − Freq > AFLmin. (1)\nFollowing the steps in CIGRE [9], and assuming fully\nreactive impedances, using Kirchhoff’s law, the contribution to fault or short circuit level caused by the SG is\ndetermined (as per (12)), where CMVA\nSG is the rated capacity\nof the synchronous unit in MegaVolt–Amperes (MVA),\nV is the voltage (on a per unit basis) at the node (which\nis assumed as 1.0), Zn is the network impedance (per\nunit) and Zi the internal (sub-transient) impedance of the\nsynchronous unit (per unit):\nFprov = CMVA\nSC × V2\nZn + Zi\n.

Depletion of fault levels through the addition of new PEC resource, illustrating the congestible nature of fault levels as an economic good.\nSource: Adapted from AEMO [2].\nThe needed fault level for the existing PEC resource is\nbased upon its minimum short circuit ratio rating and\nthe rated capacity of the PEC resource CMW\nPEC is calculated\nas\nFreq = MSCR × CMW\nPEC . (3)\nSubtractability here is assessed using the marginal\ncost of extension focussing upon outage costs and based\nupon the AFL as a relevant metric:\nmce ∼= δco (AFLmin − AFL)\nδp . (4)\nWhen the AFL is high, the addition of a new generator does not affect system strength as such. However,\nwhen AFL is low, the inclusion of a new generator can\ndeplete the available AFL capacity to a great extent. In a\nnetwork with such fault levels, a new user that is added\nat this location would essentially connect to a system\nthat has a zero AFL; thus, it is likely to increase the risk\nof system instability and consequently its outage costs.\nThis indicates that fault levels become subtractable to\nan increasing extent as the network gets congested more\nand more, suggestive of features that are compatible\nwith the definition of a congestible CPR. Finally, we note\nthat the characteristics of the user affect the marginal\ncost. A lower mce would apply to users that are less\nreliant upon a stiff system (e.g. through a lower minimum\nshort circuit ratio) or to users that actually contribute to\nsystem strength (such as through grid-formation).\nConsider a numerical example in the above system,\nwhere V = 1 per unit, Zn = 0.08j per unit, Zi = 0.02j per\nunit,AFLmin = 0 MVA and fault level contribution CMVA\nSC of\n100 MVA. In an uncongested system with CMW\nPEC =300 and\nMSCR = 2.0, the AFL would be 400 MVA, well above\nthe minimum level. In such a scenario, the effect of an\nincremental MW would be negligible, as AFLs would\nstill be high. However, in a congested system where\nCMW\nPEC = 500 MW, this resource would deplete all AFL\n(AFL = 0MVA). In such a scenario, the impacts of an\nincremental MW would be significant as the AFL would\nfall below the threshold. This, however, assumes that the\nincremental MW relies upon stiff voltages provided by\nfault current.\nAlternately, if the incremental user addition is required\n(e.g. by the regulatory regime) to have grid-forming capability (and assuming technical viability), it would not\nrely upon local fault levels and potentially add to the\nstability of the system. This indicates the importance of\nunderstanding user characteristics.\nA further practical application of the above framework\nis provided in AEMO [2]. Figure 4 illustrates the impact\nof a new inverter-based generator in the network in the\nstate of Tasmania (which is a part of the NEM of Australia). The figure illustrates that the addition of the PEC\nresource depletes at particular nodes, such as N3 the AFL.\nExcess fault levels remain at other nodes and as such the\naddition of this resource would not be a cause a concern\n(this includes nodes such as N4 and N5). Illustrative of\nfault levels being more rival at places where the grid is\ncongested; this is supportive of treating this electricity\nsystem service as a CCPR."

We assess four classes of ESS comprising\ninertia and frequency response, voltage control, system\nstrength and differentiated reliability.\nDifferentiated reliability is a class of products offering\ndifferential electric service quality or priority [6]. The\nconcept of differential reliability encompasses a scheme\nfor the supply of electricity based on priority service [35].\nPriority service offers consumers choices from a menu of\nreliability differentiated service options. Customers can\nchoose to allocate different plans to strips of power (i.e.\nsuch as different devices), based on essentiality of use.\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ooenergy/article/doi/10.1093/ooenergy/oiac007/6652147 by guest on 09 May 2023\nBillimoria et al. | 9\nTable 2.

Services like inertia and frequency response have limited subtractability and strong\npublic good characteristics while others, like fault levels\nand voltage control products,might be more subtractable\nespecially in the face of congestion. This suggests that\nthe CPR classification is more relevant. Further, heterogeneity is observed when examining differentiated reliability products, a class of products offering differential\nelectric service quality or priority [6]. In such cases, consumers can be curtailed from electric service dependent\nupon the service level being subscribed. This suggests\nthat the service is excludable. These products are also\nrival because they relate to the consumption of a finite\nsupply of energy at each interval. This implies a private\ngoods characterization of such products.\nThese characteristics may also be transformed through\nindustry regulation and/or technology advancement. For\nexample, grid codes requiring advanced stability control\nsystems (e.g. over-voltage or under-voltage automatic\ndisconnection) for PEC resources may reduce the reliance\nupon grid strength as the resources themselves become\ninherently stronger and more resilient.\nThe ‘basket of goods’ characterization has important\nimplications for market design including the following.\n• Common pool characterizations of goods are increasingly relevant and highlight the importance of\nadaptive governance approaches that cater more\nspecifically to local network topologies, user characteristics and conditions [39]. Particular aspects\nof CPR management that are important to power\nsystem security include (i) local co-ordination and\ncooperation (with potentially better siting and sizing\nof system resources); (ii) the use of graduated sanctions, though constraint management for instance, to\nincentivize good ‘user and provider’ behaviour; and\n(iii) the need for f lexible and tailored solutions rather\nthan large scale, homogenized ‘commodification’\n[51].\n• The inseparability of products with different economic characterizations. The provision of inertia\n(public good) and system strength (congestible\nCPR) by a synchronous generator, for instance, are\ninseparable. The approach to the procurement of one\ngood will thus affect the other, with consequences\nthat are nontrivial to handle from an economic\nperspective.\n• Frameworks for market access and curtailment.\nIt is also relevant to examine the framework of\nconnection right and access to the grid. For example,\nmany of the control systems that impact upon\npower system security can be regulated through the\nconnection approvals process [19]. This may ensure\nthat new users make some form of contribution\nto the ‘common pool’. In certain jurisdictions, this\nhas also required new investment in plant such\nas synchronous condensers to mitigate any harm\ncaused to system security from the connection.\nSecondly, access regimes can also govern the rights\nand obligations of new connections with respect to\ncurtailment, with firmer regimes providing stronger\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ooenergy/article/doi/10.1093/ooenergy/oiac007/6652147 by guest on 09 May 2023\n10 | Oxford Open Energy, 2022, Vol. 1, No. 1\nFigure 5.

Striking the right\nbalance between access rights, technical mandates\nand market mechanisms is a difficult regulatory task.\n• Incentives for investment. While investment in system security assets can arise from the network connection process, it can also be facilitated by a centralized process. A central process could allow goods\nto be procured together (such as system strength\nand inertia). This could provide rationale for buying ‘super-products’—where several products can be\naggregated and procured together. The recent Stability Pathfinder procurement by National Grid [36] is an\nexample of this. An important question is therefore\nthe terms of procurement. While spot markets can\ncreate scarcity signals, it is questionable whether\nthey are able to drive investment in the absence of\nrivalry and incentives for risk hedging [41]. In contrast\nto the energy spot markets where volatile prices can\ndrive contracting, many products are non-rival that\nencourages free-riding and dampens the incentive\nfor contracting. While this may be practically justifiable for services that represent a small portion of\ngenerators’ existing energy revenue base, it is less so\nwhere the investment justification for new assets is\nhighly dependent on revenues from the delivery of\nsystem services (such as battery storage). This might\nbecome crucial for balancing and reserve services as\nzero-marginal cost resources increasingly dominate\nthe market. In these circumstances, in addition to\nshort-term markets, a long-term centralized (public)\nprocurement programme may be required.\nDISCUSSION\nEMERGING DESIGN MODELS FOR\nOPERATIONAL SECURITY\nMarket and regulatory designs need to be sufficiently\nnuanced to deal with the techno-economic complexity\nof ESSs. We summarize, in Table 3, five canonical models\nof design for system services developed with a mind\nto the following principles: (i) design suited to the\neconomic characteristics of underlying system security\ngoods; (ii) consistency between access frameworks,\nmarkets and agency incentives; (iii) the objective of\nincentive-compatibility weighted against; (iv) design\ncomplexity and practicality; and (v) the capability to\naddress emerging technologies, stakeholders and market\narchitectures discussions (such as increased distributed\nenergy resource proliferation or the growth of multienergy systems). A description of the canonical designs\nfollows in Note S3 (with architectures illustrated in\nFigs S3.1 and S3.4).\nIn the centralized procurement model, responsibility\nfor the management of system security is designated to\none or more central agencies, on a short as well as longterm basis. Critical to success of this model is the need for\nsystem-wide renewable integration objectives that guide\nthe central agencies and form a basis for their incentives.\nIn this system, the central agency must be motivated\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ooenergy/article/doi/10.1093/ooenergy/oiac007/6652147 by guest on 09 May 2023\nBillimoria et al. | 11\nTable 3.

Regulation\nmay be required to guide central agency decision\nmaking, perhaps combined with innovative performance\nmanagement frameworks [22]. The centralized approach\nis well suited to public goods. CPR system services could\nalso be incorporated under a centralized framework,\nbut consideration needs to be given to how the service\nis allocated during scarcity. Access frameworks and\nrenewable integration objectives would also need to\nsupport this.\nDecentralized approaches can incentivize investment\nthrough cost or quantity allocations to market participants or through the network connection process itself.\nWhile this offers the efficiencies and innovation that\nmarket-driven contracting and investment can bring, it is\ncritical to appropriately specify the quantity and quality\nrequirements of the relevant system services. This may\nbe difficult for less definable and measurable system\nservices (such as system strength). In some cases, the\nemergence of new technical issues could result in underprocurement and may leave the system vulnerable.\nTo mitigate this challenge, hybrid regimes can establish strong grid standards but with backstop measures to\ndeal with larger risks. This procurement can be funded\nin whole or part by charges levied on new resources\nconnecting to the network. Such approaches help a central party to integrate long-term system planning and\ninvestment with the connection regime. This is more\ncomplex in a market in which generation resources entry\nand exit are totally unregulated and as such may require\na structured and regionally co-ordinated approach to\nconnections and access.\nFinally, we also propose a hybrid model underpinned\nby locally facilitated co-ordination (Fig. 6). The key\nconcept here is that local platforms are established\nto facilitate co-ordination and collective action. These\nplatforms offer local planning and aggregated grid\nconnection access, as well as matching services between\nresources that are becoming connected and providers.\nThis idea is inherent in regional renewable energy zone\nframeworks in ERCOT region and the NEM of Australia\n[3]. In this model, instead of system-wide renewable\nelectricity targets, the governments and power system\nplanner would approach the issue of renewable integration more on a strategic basis such that a greater focus\nis placed on regional features. This further incentivizes\npartnerships between government and industry to\nfacilitate co-ordinated renewable expansion. Finally, this\nhybrid approach is also suited to emergent distributed\nenergy marketplaces [8], distributed energy resource\ntechnical and commercial aggregation schemes such as\ncommunity energy systems, microgrid and virtual power\nplants based on multi-energy system f lexibility [29], and\nconsumer-centric economic arrangements such as based\non peer-to-peer trading [34].\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ooenergy/article/doi/10.1093/ooenergy/oiac007/6652147 by guest on 09 May 2023\n12 | Oxford Open Energy, 2022, Vol. 1, No. 1\nFigure 6. Hybrid centralized–decentralized model underpinned by locally facilitated co-ordination.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe management of operation security in an inverter\ndominated grid poses a new set of challenges for system\noperators and market designers calling for a reintegration of economic frameworks with our evolving understanding of the system’s new physics. In this paper, we\nhave assessed the key technical challenges for managing\nsecurity and provided a framework for the economic\ncharacterization of the technical goods that a power\nsystem may need.\nThere are five key messages that are an outcome\nof this analysis. First, security in low-carbon power\nsystems is a technically complex topic. The transition to\nsynchronously decoupled technology introduces neverbefore seen technical scarcities (such as inertia and\nsystem strength). Power system parameters are also\nincreasingly interactive, uncertain and unpredictable—\nwith potential not only for co-optimization but also\nundesired cross-service effects. While new technology\nhas the potential to offer solutions, it requires regulatory\nand/or market incentives to implement. New operational\nmechanisms also need to be put in place to incentivize\noptimal solutions and identify true trade-offs. Second,\nthe economics of power system security are just as, if\nnot more, complex and intricate involving a multitude of\ngrid services with differing characteristics. The technical\ncomplexity of such services translates to heterogenous\neconomic characterizations—‘a basket of goods’. In\nparticular, a range of services essential for the future grid\ndisplay the characteristics of congestible CPRs necessitating a nuanced and localized approach to regulatory\ndesign. Third, a failure to link technical requirements to\neconomics risks incentive-incompatible market design.\nFourth, a bottom-up ‘physics-to-economics’ approach\nis required to appropriately characterize the economic\ncharacteristics of new security services, and market\ndesign must ref lect these characteristics. Finally, five\ncanonical market designs are presented that vary from\ncentralized procurement, to decentralized approaches\nand hybrid models that aim to bridge between central\nand localized provision of services."

Each design has its unique approach to quantification of services, procurement responsibility, character of goods, renewable objectives, access frameworks, and operational scheduling/dispatch. Here's an in-depth look at each market design:\n\n1. Centralized procurement: In this model, responsibility for managing system security is designated to one or more central agencies, both short-term and long-term. The central agency must be motivated to make efficient decisions around procurement and anticipate future needs. This design is well-suited for public goods and common pool resources (CPRs) if managed properly. Access frameworks and renewable integration objectives need to support this model.\n\n2. Decentralized procurement via cost or quantity allocations: In this design, investment incentives are provided through cost or quantity allocations to market participants. While this approach can bring market-driven efficiencies and innovation, specifying the quantity and quality requirements of the relevant system services may be challenging, especially for less definable and measurable services. This might result in under-procurement, leaving the system vulnerable.\n\n3. Decentralized procurement via network access: In this model, procurement occurs through the network connection process itself. While this can incentivize investment, it may lead to suboptimal outcomes if the connection process doesn't consider the overall system needs. Striking the right balance between access rights, technical mandates, and market mechanisms is a difficult regulatory task in this design.\n\n4. Hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement: This design combines strong grid standards with backstop measures to deal with larger risks. Procurement can be funded in whole or part by charges levied on new resources connecting to the network. This approach helps integrate long-term system planning and investment with the connection regime, which is more complex in a market where generation resources entry and exit are unregulated.\n\n5. Decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination: In this hybrid model, local platforms are established to facilitate coordination and collective action. These platforms offer local planning, aggregated grid connection access, and matching services between resources and providers. This design is well-suited for emergent distributed energy marketplaces, distributed energy resource technical and commercial aggregation schemes, and consumer-centric economic arrangements such as peer-to-peer trading.\n\nThe economics of these market designs hinge upon the classification of power system security products and services as a set of goods with varying public and private characteristics. The designs aim to balance efficiency, security, and investment incentives while taking into account the complex technical and economic aspects of the power system. The choice of a suitable market design depends on the specific context, characteristics of the power system, and the goals and objectives of policymakers and regulators."

        "text": "The five canonical market designs for operational security in low-carbon power systems address the challenges of integrating low-carbon resources while maintaining power system security. Each design has its own unique features, advantages, and drawbacks. Here, we provide a more in-depth analysis of each of these designs and their implications on the economics of power system security.\n\n1. Centralized procurement: In this model, a central agency is responsible for managing system security on both short and long-term basis. The central agency needs to be motivated to make efficient decisions around procurement and anticipate future needs of the system. This design is well suited for public goods and common pool resources (CPR) system services. However, it requires clear system-wide renewable integration objectives and appropriate regulation to guide the central agency's decision-making.\n\nEconomically, centralized procurement can help achieve economies of scale, reduce transaction costs, and ensure the provision of public goods. However, it may not always lead to the most efficient allocation of resources, as it relies on the central agency's ability to predict future needs and market conditions accurately.\n\n2. Decentralized procurement via cost or quantity allocations: In this model, market participants are incentivized to invest in system security through cost or quantity allocations. While this design allows for more market-driven contracting and investment, specifying the quantity and quality requirements for system services can be challenging. This may lead to under-procurement and leave the system vulnerable to new technical issues.\n\nEconomically, decentralized procurement encourages innovation and competition among market participants. However, it may fail to provide adequate system security if the quantity and quality requirements are not appropriately specified.\n\n3. Decentralized procurement via network access: This design procures system security services through the network connection process. It requires strong grid standards and backstop measures to deal with larger risks. Procurement can be funded in part by charges levied on new resources connecting to the network, allowing for more integration between long-term system planning and investment with the connection regime.\n\nEconomically, this design can create incentives for market participants to invest in system security while maintaining a more decentralized approach. However, it can be complex to implement, especially in markets where generation resources entry and exit are unregulated.\n\n4. Hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement: This model combines features of both centralized and decentralized procurement, aiming to strike a balance between the efficiency of market-driven investment and the need for central planning to ensure system security. It can involve a central agency procuring some services while leaving others to be procured by market participants.\n\nEconomically, the hybrid approach can benefit from the advantages of both centralized and decentralized procurement. It can enable market-driven innovation while ensuring adequate system security through central planning and coordination.\n\n5. Decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination: This design is based on locally facilitated coordination, where local platforms are established to facilitate cooperation and collective action. These platforms can offer local planning, aggregated grid connection access, and matching services between resources and providers. This approach is well suited for emergent distributed energy marketplaces, distributed energy resource aggregation schemes, and consumer-centric economic arrangements.\n\nEconomically, this design can promote regional cooperation and coordination, allowing for more tailored solutions that account for local network topologies and user characteristics. However, it may require more complex coordination mechanisms and rely on the willingness of market participants to collaborate effectively.\n\nIn summary, each of the five canonical market designs has its own strengths and weaknesses in addressing the technical and economic challenges of power system security in low-carbon electricity systems. The choice of the most suitable design depends on the specific context, characteristics of the power system, and the objectives of policy-makers and regulators."

Introduce the market designs, evaluate their characteristics using each model, sumarize the benefits and drawbacks and finnaly asign a final rating.\n\nSUMARY:\nThe authors of the paper present a case study on system strength and fault levels in weak grids, which are becoming an emerging challenge in regions with high inverter-based penetration. They use the metric of available fault level (AFL) as a key factor to provide a conceptual understanding of the economic characterization of system strength, although they acknowledge that this is a simplification of a highly complex and dynamic system.\n\n\nThe case study follows a four-step process:\n\n\nProduct appropriation and appropriators: Identifying how power system security is consumed and who the consumers are. In this case, both generators and consumers of electricity benefit from a stable grid that facilitates energy trade.\n\nExcludability: Determining whether a system service can be physically excluded from a user. For many system services, users cannot be naturally excluded, while some services can be considered excludable if a user can be curtailed.\n\nSubtractability and jointness of use: Assessing the marginal cost of extension, which is the cost of extending a good or service to a new beneficiary or user. Goods that are subtractable have a positive marginal cost of extension.\n\nTransformation: Considering the potential for the transformation of the service based on the framework of laws and regulations in place, and any market frameworks.\n\n\nThe case study illustrates that fault levels become increasingly subtractable as the network gets more congested, suggesting features that are compatible with the definition of a congestible common pool resource (CPR). This highlights the importance of understanding user characteristics when considering the impact of an incremental addition to the grid.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the case study demonstrates the practical application of the proposed framework for the economic characterization of power system security goods. By considering factors such as excludability, subtractability, and transformation, policy-makers and regulators can better understand the dynamics of power system security in weak grids and design more effective market and regulatory frameworks for low-carbon electricity systems."

        "text": "A low-carbon resource refers to an energy source that produces minimal or significantly reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), when compared to traditional fossil fuel-based energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Low-carbon resources are essential in mitigating climate change and transitioning to a more sustainable energy system.\n\nExamples of low-carbon resources include:\n\n1. Renewable energy sources: These are naturally replenished and include solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. They generate electricity with little to no greenhouse gas emissions during their operation.\n\n2. Nuclear power: Although not a renewable resource, nuclear power produces low levels of carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels. It relies on nuclear reactions to generate heat, which is then used to produce electricity.\n\n3. Carbon capture and storage (CCS): This technology captures carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial processes and stores them safely underground, preventing them from being released into the atmosphere. While not an energy source itself, CCS can be applied to fossil fuel-based power generation, effectively lowering its carbon emissions.\n\n4. Energy efficiency measures: Improving energy efficiency in various sectors, such as buildings, transportation, and industry, can effectively reduce overall carbon emissions by consuming less energy while maintaining the same level of service or output.\n\nLow-carbon resources play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a more sustainable, environmentally friendly energy system to combat climate change."

The authors of the paper propose a physics-informed approach to classify power system security products and services, identifying five canonical market designs to address these challenges: centralized procurement, decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation, decentralized procurement via network access, hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement, and decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination. This report evaluates each market design using the given models, summarizing their benefits, drawbacks, and assigning a final rating.\n\n\nCentralized Procurement:\nCentralized procurement designates responsibility for system security to one or more central agencies. This design is well-suited for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP), as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously. However, it may not be as effective in the Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination.\n\nBenefits:\n\n\nEffective for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities (CEP).\nCentralized coordination ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n\nLess effective in GEP and TEP models due to the lack of centralized coordination.\n\nFinal Rating: 3/5\n\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation:\nThis design relies on market participants to procure system security services through cost or quantity allocations. It may perform better in the GEP and TEP models, as these models focus on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it might not be ideal for the CEP model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\nBenefits:\n\n\nEncourages market-driven contracting and investment.\nBetter suited for GEP and TEP models.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n\nLacks centralized coordination for joint optimization (CEP).\n\nFinal Rating: 3/5\n\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access:\nUnder this design, the responsibility for procuring system security services lies with individual connecting resources. This approach may work better with the TEP and GEP models, as it allows resources to make investments based on local conditions and constraints. However, it may not be as effective under the CEP model due to the lack of centralized coordination.\n\nBenefits:\n\n\nAllows for local coordination and investment decisions.\nBetter suited for TEP and GEP models.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n\nLess effective in CEP model due to a lack of centralized coordination.\n\nFinal Rating: 3/5\n\n\nHybrid Centralized-Decentralized Procurement:\nThis design combines elements of both centralized and decentralized procurement models, making it a flexible option for various models. It could perform well under the CEP model, as it allows for centralized coordination while still giving connecting resources the flexibility to make investments. This design may also be suitable for the GEP and TEP models, as it balances centralized coordination with decentralized decision-making.\n\nBenefits:\n\n\nFlexible option for various models.\nBalances centralized coordination with decentralized decision-making.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n\nMay not outperform specialized designs in specific scenarios.\n\nFinal Rating: 4/5\n\n\nDecentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination:\nIn this hybrid model, local platforms are established to facilitate coordination and collective action among connecting resources. This design is better suited for handling complex common pool resources and promoting coordinated renewable expansion. It may perform well under the TEP and GEP models, as it allows for local coordination and investment decisions. However, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the lack of centralized coordination.\n\nBenefits:\n\n\nSupports complex common pool resources and coordinated renewable expansion.\nBetter suited for TEP and GEP models.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n\nLimited performance under the CEP model due to a lack of centralized coordination.\n\nFinal Rating: 4/5\n\n\nConclusion:\nEach of the five market designs for operational"

Centralized procurement is one of the market designs proposed to address these challenges. This report focuses on the benefits and drawbacks of centralized procurement for operational security in low-carbon power systems, particularly in the context of the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP), Generation Expansion Problem (GEP), and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models.\n\n1. Introduction:\nPower system security is essential for maintaining the stability and reliability of electricity grids, especially as the integration of low-carbon resources increases. Centralized procurement designates responsibility for system security to one or more central agencies, which coordinate the procurement of essential system security services. This report examines the performance of centralized procurement in the context of the CEP, GEP, and TEP models, highlighting its benefits and drawbacks.\n\n2. Centralized Procurement Overview:\nCentralized procurement involves a central agency or organization responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. This central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is well-suited for the CEP model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.\n\n3. Benefits of Centralized Procurement:\n\n- Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.\n- Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.\n- Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.\n\n4. Drawbacks of Centralized Procurement:\n\n- Less effective in GEP and TEP models: Centralized procurement may not be as effective in the GEP and TEP models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination. In these cases, decentralized procurement may be more suitable.\n- Potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency: Centralized procurement may introduce bureaucratic hurdles and potential inefficiencies, as decisions must be made by a central authority rather than individual market participants.\n\n5. Conclusion:\nCentralized procurement offers several benefits for operational security in low-carbon power systems, particularly in the context of the CEP model. However, its effectiveness may be limited in the GEP and TEP models due to a lack of centralized coordination. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between centralized and decentralized procurement models to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems."

Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is one of the market designs proposed to address these challenges. This report examines the decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design, evaluating its benefits, drawbacks, and suitability for different models in low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe transition to low-carbon power systems necessitates a rethinking of market and regulatory frameworks that govern the provision and consumption of power system security services. Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This design aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nBenefits of Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation:\n\n1. Market-driven investment decisions: This design encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.\n\n2. Incentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.\n\n3. Better suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.\n\nDrawbacks of Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation:\n\n1. Lack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.\n\n2. Potential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.\n\n3. Complexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.\n\nSuitability for Different Models:\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\nConclusion:\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation offers certain benefits, such as market-driven investment decisions and incentives for innovation, but also has drawbacks, such as lack of centralized coordination and potential for underinvestment in system security. It is better suited for GEP and TEP models and may not be ideal for the CEP model. Policymakers and regulators need to carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems."

This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.\n\n2.

Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.\n\nConclusion:\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required.

Dont write the report just give me the outline:\n\nTitle: Centralized Procurement for Operational Security in Low-Carbon Power Systems\n\nTitle: Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation in Low-Carbon Power Systems\n\n\nExecutive Summary:\nThe integration of low-carbon resources into power systems presents significant challenges for maintaining power system security. Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is one of the market designs proposed to address these challenges. This report examines the decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design, evaluating its benefits, drawbacks, and suitability for different models in low-carbon electricity systems.\n\n\nIntroduction:\nThe transition to low-carbon power systems necessitates a rethinking of market and regulatory frameworks that govern the provision and consumption of power system security services. Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This design aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\n\nBenefits of Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation:\n\n\nMarket-driven investment decisions: This design encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.\n\nIncentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.\n\nBetter suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.\n\n\nDrawbacks of Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation:\n\n\nLack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.\n\nPotential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.\n\nComplexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.\n\n\nSuitability for Different Models:\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\n\nConclusion:\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation offers certain benefits, such as market-driven investment decisions and incentives for innovation, but also has drawbacks, such as lack of centralized coordination and potential for underinvestment in system security. It is better suited for GEP and TEP models and may not be ideal for the CEP model. Policymakers and regulators need to carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nTitle: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access for Operational Security in Low-Carbon Power Systems\n\nExecutive Summary:\nThe integration of low-carbon resources into power systems presents significant challenges for maintaining power system security. This report focuses on Decentralized Procurement via Network Access, a market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources. This approach may be better suited for the Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) and Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) models, as it allows resources to make investments based on local conditions and constraints. However, it may not be as effective under the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model due to the lack of centralized coordination.\n\nIntroduction:\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that shifts the responsibility for procuring system security services from central agencies to individual connecting resources. This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.\n\n2. Encourages Competition and Innovation: By allowing multiple connecting resources to participate in the procurement of system security services, Decentralized Procurement via Network Access fosters competition and innovation in the market. This can result in the development of more effective and cost-efficient solutions for maintaining system security.\n\n3. Better Suited for TEP and GEP Models: This market design may be more effective under the TEP and GEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. This enables connecting resources to address system security challenges in a more targeted manner.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n1. Lack of Centralized Coordination: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access may not be as effective under the CEP model, which requires joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The lack of centralized coordination in this market design may limit its ability to address system security challenges effectively in such scenarios.\n\n2. Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.\n\nConclusion:\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nTitle: Exploring Hybrid Centralized-Decentralized Procurement for Operational Security in Low-Carbon Power Systems\n\n\nExecutive Summary:\nThe integration of low-carbon resources into power systems has significant implications for power system security.

Overview\n\nCentralized procurement is a market design in which one or more central agencies are responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. The central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.\n2. Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.\n3. Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1.

Potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency: Centralized procurement may introduce bureaucratic hurdles and potential inefficiencies, as decisions must be made by a central authority rather than individual market participants.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nAs a market design, centralized procurement is best suited for the CEP model, where joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is crucial for maintaining operational security in low-carbon power systems. However, for the GEP and TEP models, where decentralized coordination may be more effective, other market designs might be better suited. Policymakers and regulators should consider the specific characteristics of their power systems when selecting a market design for operational security."

        "text": "IV. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This approach aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Market-driven investment decisions: Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.\n\n2. Incentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.\n\n3. Better suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.\n\n2. Potential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.\n\n3. Complexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.\n\nD. Suitability for Different Models\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities."

Overview\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources. This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.\n\n2. Encourages Competition and Innovation: By allowing multiple connecting resources to participate in the procurement of system security services, Decentralized Procurement via Network Access fosters competition and innovation in the market. This can result in the development of more effective and cost-efficient solutions for maintaining system security.\n\n3. Better Suited for TEP and GEP Models: This market design may be more effective under the TEP and GEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. This enables connecting resources to address system security challenges in a more targeted manner.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of Centralized Coordination: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access may not be as effective under the CEP model, which requires joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The lack of centralized coordination in this market design may limit its ability to address system security challenges effectively in such scenarios.\n\n2. Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required. This market design is better suited for the TEP and GEP models, where it allows resources to make investments based on local conditions and constraints. In contrast, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the lack of centralized coordination. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems."

Background on low-carbon power systems\nB. Importance of operational security\nC. Overview of market designs\n\nIII. Centralized Procurement\nA. Overview\n\nCentralized procurement is a market design in which one or more central agencies are responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. The central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.\n2. Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.\n3. Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Less effective in GEP and TEP models: Centralized procurement may not be as effective in the GEP and TEP models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination. In these cases, decentralized procurement may be more suitable.\n2. Potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency: Centralized procurement may introduce bureaucratic hurdles and potential inefficiencies, as decisions must be made by a central authority rather than individual market participants.\n\nD.

Recommendations for policymakers and regulators:\n\nI. Executive Summary\n\nThe integration of low-carbon resources into power systems presents significant technical and economic challenges for maintaining operational security. This report evaluates five canonical market designs to address these challenges: centralized procurement, decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation, decentralized procurement via network access, hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement, and decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination. Each market design has its unique benefits and drawbacks, making them more or less suitable for different models and scenarios.\n\nCentralized procurement and decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation both receive a final rating of 3/5, as they are less effective in certain models due to their lack of centralized or decentralized coordination. Decentralized procurement via network access also receives a final rating of 3/5, as it is better suited for the Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) and Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) models but not as effective under the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model. Hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement and decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination both receive a final rating of 4/5, as they offer more flexibility and balance between centralized and decentralized decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs for operational security in low-carbon power systems. Decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination, as a hybrid market design, offers a flexible and adaptable approach to address these challenges in various scenarios and contexts. By establishing local platforms for coordination and collective action, this design promotes efficient resource allocation and supports complex common pool resources and coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nII. Introduction\nA. Background on low-carbon power systems\nLow-carbon power systems aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change by incorporating renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower, as well as energy storage and demand-side management technologies. These systems require a rethinking of conventional power system planning and operation due to the intermittent and distributed nature of renewable energy sources, changing demand patterns, and the need to decarbonize the electricity sector.\n\nB. Importance of operational security\nOperational security is essential for maintaining the reliability, stability, and quality of power systems. It involves ensuring the continuous balance between electricity supply and demand, managing grid congestion, and maintaining voltage and frequency within acceptable limits. As low-carbon resources are integrated into the grid, maintaining operational security becomes increasingly complex due to the variability and uncertainty of renewable generation, the need for flexible resources, and the interactions between transmission and distribution systems. Addressing these challenges requires innovative market designs, regulatory frameworks, and coordination mechanisms that can efficiently allocate resources and ensure system security while promoting the integration of low-carbon resources.\n\nC. Overview of market designs\nThis report provides a comprehensive evaluation of five canonical market designs tailored to address the challenges of operational security in low-carbon power systems:\n\n1. Centralized Procurement: A market design where a central authority is responsible for procuring system security services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\n2. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation: This market design relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities, promoting market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation.\n\n3. Decentralized Procurement via Network Access: A market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources, promoting market-driven investment decisions while addressing power system security challenges in low-carbon grids.\n\n4. Hybrid Centralized-Decentralized Procurement: This market design combines elements of centralized and decentralized procurement, allowing for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities while still providing flexibility for local decision-making.\n\n5. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination: A hybrid market design that combines decentralized decision-making with coordinated efforts through local platforms, allowing for local coordination and investment decisions while still promoting overall system security, making it suitable for managing complex common pool resources and promoting coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nEach market design has unique benefits and drawbacks, making them more or less suitable for different models and scenarios. The report examines these market designs in detail, assessing their suitability for various power system models, including Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP), Generation Expansion Problem (GEP), and Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) models. It also provides insights and recommendations for policymakers and regulators to consider when selecting a market design for operational security in low-carbon power systems.\n\nIII. Centralized Procurement\nA. Overview\n\nCentralized procurement is a market design in which one or more central agencies are responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. The central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.\n2. Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.\n3. Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Less effective in GEP and TEP models: Centralized procurement may not be as effective in the GEP and TEP models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination. In these cases, decentralized procurement may be more suitable.\n2. Potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency: Centralized procurement may introduce bureaucratic hurdles and potential inefficiencies, as decisions must be made by a central authority rather than individual market participants.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nAs a market design, centralized procurement is best suited for the CEP model, where joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is crucial for maintaining operational security in low-carbon power systems. However, for the GEP and TEP models, where decentralized coordination may be more effective, other market designs might be better suited. Policymakers and regulators should consider the specific characteristics of their power systems when selecting a market design for operational security.\n\nIV. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This approach aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Market-driven investment decisions: Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.\n\n2. Incentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.\n\n3. Better suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.\n\n2. Potential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.\n\n3. Complexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.\n\nD. Suitability for Different Models\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\nV. Decentralized Procurement via Network Access\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources. This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.\n\n2. Encourages Competition and Innovation: By allowing multiple connecting resources to participate in the procurement of system security services, Decentralized Procurement via Network Access fosters competition and innovation in the market. This can result in the development of more effective and cost-efficient solutions for maintaining system security.\n\n3. Better Suited for TEP and GEP Models: This market design may be more effective under the TEP and GEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. This enables connecting resources to address system security challenges in a more targeted manner.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of Centralized Coordination: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access may not be as effective under the CEP model, which requires joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The lack of centralized coordination in this market design may limit its ability to address system security challenges effectively in such scenarios.\n\n2. Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required. This market design is better suited for the TEP and GEP models, where it allows resources to make investments based on local conditions and constraints. In contrast, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the lack of centralized coordination. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nVII. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination is a hybrid market design that incorporates elements of both centralized and decentralized procurement models. It establishes local platforms to facilitate coordination and collective action among connecting resources. This design is particularly well-suited for handling complex common pool resources and promoting coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Supports complex common pool resources and coordinated renewable expansion: This design is capable of addressing the challenges associated with integrating low-carbon resources into power systems, particularly in situations where resources are shared by multiple users.\n\n2. Better suited for TEP and GEP models: Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination allows for local coordination and investment decisions, making it a suitable option for the Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) and Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) models.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Limited performance under the CEP model: The lack of centralized coordination in this design may hinder its effectiveness in the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nDecentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination is a promising option for the TEP and GEP models, where local coordination and investment decisions are essential. However, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the absence of centralized coordination.\n\nE. Case Studies and Applications\n\nThis section could include real-world examples and case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination in various contexts. These case studies could highlight how this market design has been successfully implemented in different power systems, its impact on operational security, and the lessons learned from these experiences.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\n\nA. Summary of market designs\n\nThe integration of low-carbon resources into power systems presents significant technical and economic challenges for maintaining power system security. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination, as a hybrid market design, offers a flexible and adaptable approach to address these challenges. By establishing local platforms for coordination and collective action, this design promotes efficient resource allocation and supports complex common pool resources and coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nB. Recommendations for policymakers and regulators\n\nPolicymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs for operational security in low-carbon power systems. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination is a promising option for various scenarios and contexts, making it a valuable tool for addressing the challenges associated with the integration of low-carbon resources. Policymakers and regulators should explore the potential applications of this market design and assess its suitability for their specific power systems, taking into account the unique requirements and characteristics of each context.\n\nVII.

This design is particularly effective for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\n2. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation: This market design relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities, promoting market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation.\n\n3. Decentralized Procurement via Network Access: A market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources, promoting market-driven investment decisions while addressing power system security challenges in low-carbon grids.\n\n4. Hybrid Centralized-Decentralized Procurement: This market design combines elements of centralized and decentralized procurement, allowing for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities while still providing flexibility for local decision-making.\n\n5. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination: A hybrid market design that combines decentralized decision-making with coordinated efforts through local platforms, allowing for local coordination and investment decisions while still promoting overall system security, making it suitable for managing complex common pool resources and promoting coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nEach market design has unique benefits and drawbacks, making them more or less suitable for different models and scenarios. The report examines these market designs in detail, assessing their suitability for various power system models, including Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP), Generation Expansion Problem (GEP), and Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) models. It also provides insights and recommendations for policymakers and regulators to consider when selecting a market design for operational security in low-carbon power systems.\n\nIII. Centralized Procurement\nA. Overview\n\nCentralized procurement is a market design in which one or more central agencies are responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. The central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.\n2. Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.\n3. Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Less effective in GEP and TEP models: Centralized procurement may not be as effective in the GEP and TEP models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination. In these cases, decentralized procurement may be more suitable.\n2. Potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency: Centralized procurement may introduce bureaucratic hurdles and potential inefficiencies, as decisions must be made by a central authority rather than individual market participants.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nAs a market design, centralized procurement is best suited for the CEP model, where joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is crucial for maintaining operational security in low-carbon power systems. However, for the GEP and TEP models, where decentralized coordination may be more effective, other market designs might be better suited. Policymakers and regulators should consider the specific characteristics of their power systems when selecting a market design for operational security.\n\nIV. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This approach aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Market-driven investment decisions: Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.\n\n2. Incentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.\n\n3. Better suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.\n\n2. Potential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.\n\n3. Complexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.\n\nD. Suitability for Different Models\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\nV. Decentralized Procurement via Network Access\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources. This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.\n\n2. Encourages Competition and Innovation: By allowing multiple connecting resources to participate in the procurement of system security services, Decentralized Procurement via Network Access fosters competition and innovation in the market. This can result in the development of more effective and cost-efficient solutions for maintaining system security.\n\n3. Better Suited for TEP and GEP Models: This market design may be more effective under the TEP and GEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. This enables connecting resources to address system security challenges in a more targeted manner.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of Centralized Coordination: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access may not be as effective under the CEP model, which requires joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The lack of centralized coordination in this market design may limit its ability to address system security challenges effectively in such scenarios.\n\n2. Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required. This market design is better suited for the TEP and GEP models, where it allows resources to make investments based on local conditions and constraints. In contrast, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the lack of centralized coordination. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nVII. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination is a hybrid market design that incorporates elements of both centralized and decentralized procurement models. It establishes local platforms to facilitate coordination and collective action among connecting resources. This design is particularly well-suited for handling complex common pool resources and promoting coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1.

Better suited for TEP and GEP models: Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination allows for local coordination and investment decisions, making it a suitable option for the Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) and Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) models.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Limited performance under the CEP model: The lack of centralized coordination in this design may hinder its effectiveness in the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nDecentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination is a promising option for the TEP and GEP models, where local coordination and investment decisions are essential. However, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the absence of centralized coordination.\n\nE.

However, to make the answer comprehensible, let's break down your query into simpler terms and provide a high-level overview of the plurigrid protocol for distributed transactive energy coordination.\n\n1. Plurigrid Protocol: This refers to a protocol that enables the integration of multiple energy grids or networks to work together efficiently.\n\n2. Distributed Transactive Energy Coordination: This is the process by which energy resources, including generation, storage, and demand-side resources, are coordinated and managed through market-based transactions.\n\n3. Autopoietic Ergodicity: Autopoiesis refers to the self-organization and self-maintenance of a system. Ergodicity is a concept from statistical mechanics that assumes a system will explore all possible states over time. In this context, autopoietic ergodicity implies that the plurigrid system will dynamically adapt and reorganize itself for optimal performance.\n\n4. Stigmergic Feedback: Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination, where agents in a system interact by modifying their environment. In the context of plurigrid protocol, stigmergic feedback means that the actions of individual energy resources will affect the overall system's state, leading to emergent coordination and optimization.\n\nTo summarize, the plurigrid protocol for distributed transactive energy coordination aims to create an efficient, self-organizing, and adaptive network of multiple energy grids. This is achieved through autopoietic ergodicity, which allows the system to adapt and explore various states, and stigmergic feedback, where individual actions contribute to the overall coordination and optimization of the system."

Establish a decentralized network of energy nodes (e.g., smart grids, microgrids, energy storage systems, and prosumers) to facilitate communication and coordination among the energy resources.\n\n2. Implement an autopietic ergodicity mechanism in each energy node. This mechanism will allow nodes to self-organize, adapt, and optimize their energy production, storage, and consumption based on their internal states and the observed states of neighboring nodes.\n\n3. Utilize stigmergic feedback to communicate and propagate information on energy availability, demand, and prices across the network. This feedback will be stored in a shared environment (e.g., a distributed ledger) accessible by all nodes.\n\n4. Introduce a bidding mechanism whereby nodes can submit offers and requests for energy based on their current needs, available resources, and local energy prices. These bids will be stored in the shared environment and updated periodically.\n\n5. Employ a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., proof-of-stake or federated Byzantine agreement) to process and validate the bids, ensuring that energy transactions are agreed upon by a majority of participating nodes.\n\n6. Coordinate energy transfers between nodes based on the validated bids, prioritizing transactions that optimize overall grid efficiency, stability, and sustainability.\n\n7. Continuously monitor and adjust the network's autopietic ergodicity and stigmergic feedback mechanisms to maintain optimal energy coordination and resilience in the face of fluctuating energy demands, resource availability, and external factors (e.g., weather, grid failures, or cyberattacks).\n\nBy implementing this plurigrid protocol, distributed transactive energy coordination can be achieved through self-organizing, adaptive processes that promote efficiency, resilience, and sustainability across the network."

To design a plurigrid protocol for distributed transactive energy coordination by means of autopietic ergodicity with stigmergic feedback, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Define the plurigrid architecture: Establish a decentralized and distributed network of energy resources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, energy storage systems, and demand response assets. These resources should be capable of operating autonomously and communicating with each other.\n\n2. Implement autopietic ergodicity: Enable each energy resource to self-organize, adapt, and evolve based on its historical performance and the current state of the plurigrid. This will allow the resources to autonomously optimize their operations to achieve maximum efficiency and reliability.\n\n3. Design a stigmergic feedback mechanism: Develop a system for the energy resources to communicate their current state, performance, and requirements to the rest of the plurigrid. This can be achieved through the use of digital tokens, smart contracts, or other decentralized communication methods.\n\n4. Establish a transactive energy market: Create a marketplace where energy resources can participate in energy transactions, such as buying and selling excess energy, bidding on demand response events, or trading energy for other services. This market should be designed to incentivize efficient and sustainable resource management.\n\n5. Coordinate resources using the plurigrid protocol: Utilize the autopietic ergodicity and stigmergic feedback mechanisms to optimize the coordination of energy resources in the plurigrid. This can be achieved through distributed algorithms and consensus protocols that allow resources to autonomously make decisions based on the information they receive from the rest of the plurigrid.\n\n6. Monitor and evaluate performance: Continuously assess the performance of the plurigrid protocol in terms of efficiency, reliability, sustainability, and resilience. Use this information to iteratively update and improve the protocol over time.\n\nBy implementing these steps, a plurigrid protocol for distributed transactive energy coordination by means of autopietic ergodicity with stigmergic feedback can be achieved. This will enable the creation of a more efficient, sustainable, and resilient energy system that can adapt and evolve to meet the changing needs of the environment and society."

The fees collected from reworlding (retraining and updating microworlds using the latest version of Plurigrid) could be used to cover the costs associated with worlding (providing energy/compute availability for microworld NFT owners).\n\nThis would create an incentive for users to continuously improve their microworlds while ensuring the system has the necessary resources to support the network as it grows. In this model, the fees generated from reworlding would help maintain and compensate the providers of distributed computing resources, allowing the Plurigrid system to continue offering value to NFT holders and other participants.\n\nOf course, this is just one possible solution, and the actual implementation might involve additional mechanisms or adjustments to ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of the network.\n\nNow it also needs to include thermodynamic and reachsbilitu considerations for updating the system if we are wrong\n\nPerfect!! Can include consideration of total energy flow under MARL and how these incentives could be applied to place a battery + energy considerations for consensus making\n\nThe key is to get the core circular economy right though"

By integrating thermodynamic and reachability considerations, the system can better adapt to changes and uncertainties, ensuring a more robust and efficient energy distribution network.\n\n1. Thermodynamic considerations: By incorporating thermodynamic principles, the Plurigrid system can optimize energy flows and minimize losses during energy generation, storage, and distribution. This will lead to a more efficient use of resources, reducing the overall energy footprint and contributing to a more sustainable circular economy.\n\n2. Reachability considerations: Assessing the reachability of different states in the Plurigrid system can help identify potential bottlenecks or vulnerabilities in the network. By analyzing these factors, the system can make informed decisions on how to optimize resource allocation, improve network resilience, and ensure seamless energy distribution.\n\n3. MARL (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) for energy flow optimization: Using MARL, the Plurigrid system can learn from the interactions between multiple agents (e.g., energy generators, storage systems, and consumers) to optimize energy flows in the network. This approach allows the system to adapt to changing conditions and learn from historical data to improve overall performance.\n\n4. Incentives for battery placement and energy considerations in consensus making: Integrating incentives for strategic battery placement can help balance supply and demand, enhance grid stability, and minimize energy losses. Additionally, incorporating energy considerations into consensus-making mechanisms can further contribute to the optimization of the Plurigrid network, ensuring that decisions made are energy-efficient and sustainable.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, the Plurigrid system can establish a strong foundation for its core circular economy, ensuring long-term sustainability and resilience in the face of uncertainties and changing conditions."

Incorporating thermodynamic and reachability considerations, as well as total energy flow under Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), will contribute to a more robust and sustainable model. Let's discuss how these elements can be integrated into the Plurigrid framework:\n\n1. Thermodynamic considerations: By taking into account the energy consumption and waste heat generated by the system, the Plurigrid protocol can optimize its energy usage and promote environmentally sustainable practices. This also involves balancing the energy supply and demand within the network, which can be achieved through efficient energy resource allocation and smart grid technologies.\n\n2. Reachability considerations: Ensuring that the Plurigrid system can update and evolve over time is crucial for its long-term success. By designing the network to be adaptable and responsive to changes in both technological advancements and user demands, the system can maintain its relevance and effectiveness.\n\n3. Total energy flow under MARL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning can be applied to optimize energy distribution and resource management within the Plurigrid system. By allowing agents to learn and adapt in response to their environment, MARL can help identify the most efficient strategies for energy generation, storage, and consumption.\n\n4. Incentives for battery placement and energy considerations in consensus making: Providing incentives for the strategic placement of energy storage systems, such as batteries, can help balance the energy supply and demand within the network. Additionally, incorporating energy considerations into the consensus-making process will encourage more energy-efficient solutions and promote sustainability.\n\nBy addressing these elements and focusing on creating a circular economy within the Plurigrid system, the network can achieve long-term viability and sustainability. It's essential to continually refine and adjust the mechanisms and incentives involved in the system to maintain its effectiveness and resilience in the face of evolving challenges and opportunities."
