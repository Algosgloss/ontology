# Shawarma: A Data Structure and Protocol for Distributed Coordination of the Grid

**Abstract**

Shawarma is a data structure and protocol designed for distributed coordination of grid computing systems. It aims to facilitate task assignment, rebalancing, coordination, consensus, and dependency management across a network of devices in a local-first, peer-to-peer manner. This paper presents a comparison of different data structures and their potential implementations in Rust, including benefits, drawbacks, and examples. The focus is on ensuring compatibility with WebAssembly (WASM) and addressing key concepts such as decision trees, rebalancing, Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), consensus, peer-to-peer local-first operation, and task assignment.

**1. Introduction**

Grid computing systems require efficient coordination mechanisms for managing and distributing tasks among devices, as well as handling changes in load or capacity. In this paper, we explore various data structures and protocols that can be used to support such coordination in a local-first, peer-to-peer manner. We present Rust code snippets, discuss required libraries and tools, and provide examples of how task assignment, rebalancing, coordination, consensus, and dependency trees can be implemented for each data structure. The goal is to propose a comprehensive specification for Shawarma, a data structure, and protocol that can effectively address the challenges of distributed coordination of the grid.

**2. Data Structures and Protocols**

In this section, we discuss different data structures and their potential implementations in Rust, focusing on their benefits and drawbacks. We also provide Rust code snippets and discuss required libraries and tools.

### 2.1 Graph

A graph is a versatile data structure that can represent devices as nodes and task assignments or dependencies as edges.

#### Benefits

- Graphs can naturally express complex relationships and dependencies between tasks and devices.
- Numerous graph algorithms are available for solving various optimization problems, such as task assignment and resource allocation.

#### Drawbacks

- Handling dynamic changes in the graph structure, such as adding or removing nodes/edges, can be challenging.
- Ensuring conflict-free synchronization in a distributed environment can be difficult without using additional data structures, such as CRDTs.

#### Rust Implementation

```rust
use petgraph::Graph;
use petgraph::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let mut graph = Graph::<&str, &str>::new();
    let a = graph.add_node("Device A");
    let b = graph.add_node("Device B");

    graph.add_edge(a, b, "Task 1");
}
```

**3. Task Assignment, Rebalancing, Coordination, Consensus, and Dependency Trees**

In this section, we provide examples of how task assignment, rebalancing, coordination, consensus, and dependency trees can be implemented for each data structure.

### 3.1 Graph

#### Task Assignment

Task assignment in a graph can be performed by adding a directed edge from a device node to a task node.

```rust
fn assign_task(graph: &mut Graph<&str, &str>, device: NodeIndex, task: NodeIndex) {
    graph.add_edge(device, task, "Assignment");
}
```

#### Rebalancing

Rebalancing can be done by reassigning tasks to devices based on an optimization algorithm or heuristic, such as the minimum spanning tree or shortest path algorithms.

```rust
fn rebalance_tasks(graph: &mut Graph<&str, &str>) {
    // Implement the rebalancing algorithm here
}
```

#### Coordination

Coordination between devices can be achieved by exchanging messages or updates along the edges in the graph. This can be done using a gossip protocol such as the one provided by the `plumtree` crate.

#### Consensus

Consensus among devices can be reached using graph-based consensus algorithms, such as the Paxos or Raft algorithms. These algorithms can be implemented on top of the existing graph data structure.

#### Dependency Trees

Dependency trees can be naturally represented in a graph by adding directed edges between tasks according to their dependencies.

```rust
fn add_dependency(graph: &mut Graph<&str, &str>, task1: NodeIndex, task2: NodeIndex) {
    graph.add_edge(task1, task2, "Dependency");
}
```

### 3.2 Petri Nets

#### Task Assignment

In a Petri net, task assignment can be modeled as a transition between places representing device states.

```rust
fn assign_task(petri_net: &mut PetriNet, device_place: NodeIndex, task_transition: NodeIndex) {
    petri_net.graph.add_edge(device_place, task_transition, "Assignment");
}
```

#### Rebalancing

Rebalancing tasks in a Petri net can be done by modifying the structure of the net to achieve a more balanced distribution of tasks among devices.

```rust
fn rebalance_tasks(petri_net: &mut PetriNet) {
    // Implement the rebalancing algorithm here
}
```

#### Coordination

Coordination between devices can be achieved through the firing of transitions and the exchange of tokens among places in the Petri net.

#### Consensus

Consensus among devices can be reached by designing a Petri net that models the consensus algorithm, such as Paxos or Raft.

#### Dependency Trees

Dependency trees can be represented in a Petri net by modeling task dependencies as sequences of transitions and places.

```rust
fn add_dependency(petri_net: &mut PetriNet, task1_transition: NodeIndex, task2_transition: NodeIndex) {
    // Add a place to represent the dependency
    let dependency_place = petri_net.graph.add_node("Dependency");

    // Add edges to represent the order of execution
    petri_net.graph.add_edge(task1_transition, dependency_place, "Dependency");
    petri_net.graph.add_edge(dependency_place, task2_transition, "Dependency");
}
```

### 3.3 Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) Data Structures

#### Task Assignment

Task assignment in FRP can be achieved by updating the values of signals or events representing devices.

```rust
fn assign_task(device_signal: &Sink<Task>, task: Task) {
    device_signal.send(task);
}
```

#### Rebalancing

Rebalancing can be done by adjusting the values of signals or events to achieve a more balanced distribution of tasks among devices.

```rust
fn rebalance_tasks(devices: &Vec<Sink(Task)>) {
    // Implement the rebalancing algorithm here
}
```

#### Coordination

Coordination between devices can be achieved by combining and transforming signals or events using FRP combinators.

#### Consensus

Consensus among devices can be reached by modeling the consensus algorithm using FRP data structures such as signals or events.

#### Dependency Trees

Dependency trees can be represented in FRP by modeling tasks as functions and dependencies as compositions of these functions.

```rust
fn create_dependency(task1: impl Fn(Task) -> Task, task2: impl Fn(Task) -> Task) -> impl Fn(Task) -> Task {
    move |input| task2(task1(input))
}
```

### 3.4 Higher-Order Abstract Syntax (HOAS)

#### Task Assignment

Task assignment in HOAS can be achieved by creating an expression representing the assignment of a task to a device.

```rust
fn assign_task(device: Device, task: Task) -> Expression {
    Expression::Assign(task, device)
}
```

#### Rebalancing

Rebalancing tasks in HOAS can be done by adjusting the structure of the expressions to achieve a more balanced distribution of tasks among devices.

```rust
fn rebalance_tasks(expressions: &Vec<Expression>) {
    // Implement the rebalancing algorithm here
}
```

#### Coordination

Coordination between devices in HOAS can be achieved by creating expressions that represent communication or synchronization between devices.

```rust
fn coordinate_devices(device1: Device, device2: Device) -> Expression {
    Expression::Coordinate(device1, device2)
}
```

#### Consensus

Consensus among devices can be reached by modeling the consensus algorithm using HOAS expressions.

#### Dependency Trees

Dependency trees can be represented in HOAS by creating expressions that represent the dependencies between tasks.

```rust
fn create_dependency(task1: Task, task2: Task) -> Expression {
    Expression::Dependency(task1, task2)
}
```

### 3.5 Trees

#### Task Assignment

Task assignment in a tree can be performed by adding a child node to a device node representing the assigned task.

```rust
fn assign_task(tree: &mut Tree<&str>, device: NodeIndex, task: &str) {
    tree.insert(device, task);
}
```

#### Rebalancing

Rebalancing tasks in a tree can be done by reorganizing the tree structure to achieve a more balanced distribution of tasks among devices.

```rust
fn rebalance_tasks(tree: &mut Tree<&str>) {
    // Implement the rebalancing algorithm here
}
```

#### Coordination

Coordination between devices in a tree can be achieved by exchanging messages or updates along the edges in the tree. This can be done using a gossip protocol or other tree-based communication algorithms.

#### Consensus

Consensus among devices can be reached using tree-based consensus algorithms, such as the Paxos or Raft algorithms. These algorithms can be implemented on top of the existing tree data structure.

#### Dependency Trees

Dependency trees can be naturally represented in a tree by adding child nodes to task nodes according to their dependencies.

```rust
fn add_dependency(tree: &mut Tree<&str>, task1: NodeIndex, task2: &str) {
    tree.insert(task1, task2);
}
```

**4. Conclusion**

Throughout this paper, we have explored various data structures and their potential implementations in Rust for the distributed coordination of grid computing systems. We have provided examples of how task assignment, rebalancing, coordination, consensus, and dependency trees can be implemented for each data structure, including graphs, Petri nets, Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) data structures, Higher-Order Abstract Syntax (HOAS), and trees.

Our analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure in addressing the challenges of distributed coordination. Graphs offer a natural way to represent relationships and dependencies, while Petri nets provide a powerful model for concurrent and distributed systems. FRP data structures enable a declarative approach to modeling coordination, and HOAS allows for the flexible manipulation of expressions. Trees offer a hierarchical structure that can simplify complex dependency relationships.

The choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the grid computing system being developed. It is essential to consider factors such as scalability, performance, and ease of implementation when selecting the most suitable data structure.

Future work may involve implementing and evaluating the proposed techniques in real-world grid computing systems to assess their efficacy and performance. Additionally, exploring the integration of these data structures with other languages, platforms, or technologies, such as WebAssembly (WASM), may open new opportunities for distributed coordination across diverse computing environments.

By understanding and applying the appropriate data structures and algorithms, developers can create efficient, scalable, and robust grid computing systems that can harness the full potential of distributed resources to tackle complex computational challenges.
