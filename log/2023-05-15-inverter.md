Here are 5 equations in LaTeX that summarize key considerations for Plurigrid and Inverter's tokenomics in an Internet of Value paradigm:

\begin{equation}
S = M
\end{equation}

Token supply ($S$) should be limited to a maximum amount ($M$) to prevent excessive inflation.

\begin{equation}
C = f(R)
\end{equation}

Token circulation ($C$) depends on incentives for token redemption and utilization within the system ($R$).

\begin{equation}
V = \frac{dt}{dC}
\end{equation}

Token velocity ($V$) is determined by the rate of change of token circulation over time ($\frac{dt}{dC}$).

\begin{equation}
O = f(U,c)
\end{equation}

Optimal token holdings ($O$) depend on maximizing utility within the system ($U$) and coordination potential ($c$).

\begin{equation}
L = f(P,m)
\end{equation}

Liquidity ($L$) depends on the depth and breadth of token markets ($P$) and market maker incentives ($m$).

These 5 equations capture the key themes in conceptualizing Plurigrid and Inverter's tokenomics for an Internet of Value paradigm: limiting supply, incentivizing circulation, managing velocity, optimizing holdings and fostering liquidity. The token design must balance these factors to maximize the potential for automated and sustainable value flows between agents within the decentralized coordination system.
