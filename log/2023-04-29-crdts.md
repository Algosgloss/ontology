# Plurigrid collaberation tool
Gameplay:
- prompt always starts with json outline stuff
-
- textbox genrates original assci art
- remove twitter crap
- obtain the arena from github main, ontology/arena.json which will follow the arena.json.schema
- in a new branch, OPEN A DRAFT PULL REQUEST IMMEDIATELY to add `log/yyyy-mm-dd-name-<focus>.md`
- navigate to plurigrid.game OR localhost "just play"
- you will see the Plurigrid UI
- add a new tree - the System prompt will already have the necessary primitives to help you along the way
- as instructed by the textbox, paste the arena.json from GitHub ontology repo and begin going through the tasks assigned to you (you can ask !filter: Name) to use your name only
- as you go through the day, push your arena state intoe your branch (for which you opened a draft PR)
- iterate: in a separate tree on significant tasks - your goal is to fit your entire gm-gn iteration into the same tree, which means staying within the context window
- compose: as your day is unfolding, others will be working as well - they will be pasting their arena into their branch under `log/yyyy-mm-dd-name-<focus>.md`
ask Plurigrid to reconcile your arenas after pasting them one by one in the same prompt
- merge the PR with the COMPOSED arena.json ONLY AFTER THE TEAM APPROVES


# Reading list

# y-protocols
Documentation repository with some information about the protocols

## Yjs
https://docs.yjs.dev/

Yjs is a CRDT implementation that exposes its internal data structure as shared types. Shared types are common data types like Map or Array with superpowers: changes are automatically distributed to other peers and merged without merge conflicts.

Yjs is network agnostic (p2p!), supports many existing rich text editors, offline editing, version snapshots, undo/redo and shared cursors. It scales well with an unlimited number of users and is well suited for even large documents.

Providers
## y-webrtc
Uses the WebRTC technology to sync peers
## y-websocket
Uses WebSockets to sync peers
## y-sync
Rust implementation of the yjs sync protocols.

# Yrs
Rust implementation of Yjs. This repository also contains a wasm implementation and C headers.

Providers
## yrs-warp
Web socket provider using Rust tokio’s warp web server
I beliebe its a server provider not a client
# Ypy
Python bindings for Yrs. This is the implementation we use in JupyterLab’s backend.

Providers
# ypy-websocket
Uses WebSockets to sync peers

Posible tasks
1 - Update ypy to use yrs v0.15

2 - Error when moving an element from yjs https://github.com/y-crdt/ypy/issues/93

Issue in ypy you should be aware of https://github.com/y-crdt/ypy/pull/104https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-go-brrr/
