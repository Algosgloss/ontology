INTRODUCTION\nL\nARGE-SCALE modeling of the U.S. energy system\ntypically finds that low-cost approaches to decarbonization include a significant role for wind and solar resources\nsupported by substantial expansion of transmission infrastructure [1]–[3]. In U.S. systems, however, existing processes\nfor transmission planning have not led to expansion on the\nscale predicted to be beneficial by models that co-optimize\ntransmission and generation. Several factors may help explain\nthis disconnect, including conflicts between Federal and State\nregulatory authorities contributing to difficulties siting and\npermitting new lines [4], the efforts of incumbent generators\nto retain market power in their area [5], and a lack of coordination between neighboring system operators [6]. Among the\npotential contributing factors, this article focuses on the lack of\ncoordination between generation and transmission investment\nwithin the territory of a single liberalized market.\nWhile coordinating between centralized transmission planning and decentralized generation investment has always been\na challenge in liberalized electricity markets [7]–[11], the\nproblem has grown in recent years with increasing investor\ninterest in wind and solar generation [12]. At the end of 2022,\nJ. Mays is with the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Cornell\nUniversity, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA e-mail: jacobmays@cornell.edu.\ninterconnection queues for systems covering approximately 85\npercent of U.S. consumption held over 2,000 GW of capacity,\na quantity well above the amount currently operational in those\nsystems. Solar, wind, and storage represent approximately 95\npercent of the total [13]. Correspondingly, projects hoping to\nconnect to the system have reported delays in interconnection,\nbringing uncertainty and additional cost [14]. In a negative\nfeedback loop, uncertainty and delays have led project developers to submit a larger number of more speculative interconnection requests in the hopes of identifying a favorable project\nsize and location. This larger number of requests prompts\nadditional interconnection studies, leading to further delays\nin the process. From an engineering perspective, the goal of\nthe interconnection study process is to anticipate potential\nreliability problems in advance before a new generator is\nallowed to enter the market. From an economic perspective,\nhowever, long delays and cost uncertainty contravene the\nfree entry assumption of competitive markets, i.e., that new\nproducers are able to sell goods without undue barriers to\nentry.\nA. Context and Related Literature\nThis paper considers the economic and cost allocation implications of two competing approaches to the interconnection\nat the transmission level, the names of which derive from the\ngrid access reforms implemented in 2010 in the U.K. [15].\nIn U.S. systems apart from the Electric Reliability Council\nof Texas (ERCOT), network upgrades can be divided into\nthree categories: those driven by local reliability needs, those\ndetermined as part of a centralized planning process, and\nthose prompted by generator interconnection requests [6].\nThe presence of upgrades in the third category reflects the\n“invest and connect” approach to interconnection. Since these\nupgrades are myopic and geared to particular generators (or\nsmall clusters of generators), subsuming this category into\nthe second could lead to more efficient network expansion\ndecisions overall. The example of ERCOT, which follows\na “connect and manage” approach with substantially shorter\nqueue times than other U.S. systems [16], shows that the third\ncategory is not strictly necessary from a reliability perspective.\nSimply eliminating the third category of upgrades, however,\nraises two issues. First, one goal of transmission cost allocation\nis to encourage entrants to connect at favorable locations in\nthe network (e.g., near load centers). Typical practice in the\nU.S. is to allocate the cost of upgrades in the third category\nto interconnecting generators and the cost of those in the\nsecond category to loads in one or more zones that benefit\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Energy Markets, Policy, and Regulation.

A change in processes would therefore\nalter the overall cost allocation, with potential implications for\nthe efficiency of generator siting decisions [17]–[19]. Second,\nin order for the centralized process to lead to an efficient expansion, planners must have a plausible view of the generation\ninvestment decisions that will arise as a result of the chosen\ntransmission configuration [20]–[24]. This requirement is in\ntension with a core rationale of competitive markets: central\nplanners may not have an accurate view of the future costs\nand actions of potential entrants to the market. At present,\ncentralized planning processes include only generators that\nhave a signed generator interconnection agreement, implying\nthat they have already moved through the interconnection\nprocess [6]. As a result, generation and transmission expansion\ndecisions proceed in a largely myopic and sequential manner,\npotentially missing large opportunities that might be found\nwith co-optimization [25]–[27]. A change in processes could\nalter the information about future generation additions available to planners, with potential implications for the quality of\nthe resulting transmission plan.\nCurrent processes violate principles of cost allocation in\nthree ways. First, systems nominally follow the principle that\nbeneficiaries of the transmission system should pay in rough\nproportion to the benefits they receive [28]. Since network\nupgrades prompted by generator interconnection potentially\nbenefit all current and future users of the network, it is unlikely\nthat allocating cost to interconnecting generators conforms to\nthis principle [29]. Second, since generators cannot change\ntheir location once constructed, it is desirable that network\ntransmission charges be determined ex ante [30], [31]. As\npreviously mentioned, prospective generators have little way to\ndetermine costs upon entering interconnection queues. Further,\nin markets with nodal pricing, such as those in the U.S.,\na portion of the total cost of transmission is implicit in\nlocational prices seen by market participants. In this context,\nuncertainty in congestion costs over a project’s life amounts\nto a failure to allocate costs ex ante. While in theory financial\ntransmission rights (FTRs) could be used to convert uncertain\ncongestion costs into a stable transmission charge [32], [33],\nthere is at present no evidence that FTRs have been used to\nsupport project finance [34]. More generally, FTR markets\nin the U.S. have encountered a number of problems since\ntheir inception, leading many to question whether they are\naccomplishing their stated aims [35]. Along these lines, while\nnodal markets provide superior incentives for generation siting\nin expectation [17], [36], their performance depends on the\nability of market participants to effectively manage congestion\nrisk [37], [38]. The issue of liquidity in these hedging markets\nfeatures prominently in debates about moving from a zonal to\na nodal design in Europe. Third, efficiency suggests that on\nthe margin, costs should be assigned to those in a position to\ncontrol them [39], [40]. In the transmission context, generators\nhave limited ability to influence either the initial cost of\nnetwork upgrades or the ongoing cost of congestion. Instead,\nthese costs are governed by decisions made by transmission\nowners and system planners with no direct financial stake in\nthe outcome. In situations where transmission owners also\nown generation assets, the financial incentives may in fact\npush in the opposite direction: given the discretion incumbent\ntransmission owners have in planning processes, they may\npreferentially promote network upgrades that benefit affiliated\ngenerators.\nWhile similar issues affect the interconnection of resources\nat the distribution level, the lack of economic dispatch and\nnodal prices in that context creates different challenges for\ncost allocation. Accordingly, this paper limits the discussion\nto the transmission level."

Proposed Reforms\n\nTo address the issues discussed in the previous section, this paper proposes a shift from the current \"invest and connect\" approach to a \"connect and manage\" approach for generator interconnection in the US electricity markets. This reform entails the following changes:\n\n1. Eliminate the third category of network upgrades prompted by generator interconnection requests, and include these upgrades in the centralized planning process. This change will help improve the efficiency of network expansion decisions.\n\n2. Introduce a new financial right connected with transmission service, which allows generators to trade uncertain network upgrade and congestion costs for a fixed interconnection fee. This change will improve the ex-ante cost allocation for generators and provide better incentives for efficient generator siting.\n\n3.

Simulation\n\nThe proposed reforms are tested using a stylized two-node system to demonstrate their potential to facilitate a transition to clean technologies. The simulation results show that the \"connect and manage\" approach can effectively address the issues related to inefficient coordination between generation and transmission investment and promote the integration of renewable resources.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, this paper highlights the challenges of coordinating decentralized generation investment and centralized transmission planning in liberalized electricity markets, particularly in the context of rapid decarbonization. The proposed shift to a \"connect and manage\" approach and the introduction of a new financial right connected with transmission service can help resolve the issues related to inefficient interconnection of new resources, resource adequacy, and incumbent generator protection.

        "text": "In summary, the paper addresses the inefficient coordination between decentralized generation investment and centralized transmission planning in liberalized electricity markets, which acts as a barrier to rapid decarbonization. The author identifies a negative feedback loop that prevents efficient interconnection of new resources in U.S. markets, links it to conceptual flaws in current resource adequacy constructs, and discusses how it protects incumbent generators. The paper recommends a shift to a \"connect and manage\" approach and proposes a new financial right connected with transmission service. The goal is to improve the quality of information about new generation included in forward-looking planning processes and facilitate a transition to clean technologies."

The economics of using a flat rate can be explained through the following points:\n\n1. Predictability: A flat rate provides certainty and predictability for power generators regarding the cost of connecting to the grid. This allows them to make better-informed decisions about their investments and reduces the risk of unexpected costs related to grid upgrades and congestion.\n\n2. Simplicity: Charging a flat rate simplifies the interconnection process by eliminating the need for complex calculations and negotiations related to grid upgrade costs and congestion charges. This can reduce administrative burdens and make the overall process more efficient.\n\n3. Fairness: A flat rate ensures that all power generators pay the same fee for connecting to the grid, regardless of their size, technology, or location. This creates a level playing field and prevents potential discrimination against certain types of generators.\n\n4. Incentives for efficient siting: While flat rates provide predictability, they should be designed in a way that encourages power generators to locate their facilities in areas where they will have the least impact on the grid and cause the least amount of congestion. This can be achieved by adjusting the flat rate based on factors such as proximity to load centers or existing transmission infrastructure.\n\n5.

While the exact method for calculating the rate might vary depending on the specific market or regulatory context, here are some general steps that could be followed:\n\n1. Determine the base cost: The base cost represents the average cost of connecting a power generator to the grid. This can be calculated by analyzing historical data on interconnection costs and grid upgrades, taking into account the costs of materials, labor, and other associated expenses.\n\n2. Factor in location-specific costs: Location-specific costs account for differences in the costs of connecting generators in different areas. These costs can vary depending on factors such as the distance to existing transmission infrastructure, the complexity of the terrain, and the availability of suitable sites for new generators. To account for these factors, the base cost can be adjusted using location-specific multipliers or adders.\n\n3. Consider congestion and network impact: The flat rate should also take into account the potential impact of a new generator on the transmission grid, particularly in terms of congestion. This can be done by assessing the generator's proximity to load centers, the existing capacity of the transmission lines, and the expected growth in electricity demand in the area. Generators that are expected to have a lower impact on the grid may be eligible for a lower flat rate, while those with a higher impact may be charged a higher rate.\n\n4. Include regulatory and policy factors: The flat rate calculation may need to account for any regulatory or policy requirements, such as incentives for renewable energy generation or requirements for grid reliability and resilience. These factors can be incorporated through adjustments to the base cost or the location-specific factors.\n\n5. Calculate the final flat rate: Once all the relevant factors have been accounted for, the final flat rate interconnection fee can be determined. This rate should be transparent, predictable, and fair for all power generators, regardless of their size, technology, or location.\n\nIt is important to note that the methodology for calculating and adjusting the flat rate should be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure it remains accurate and relevant in the face of changing market conditions, technological advancements, and policy priorities."

While the exact methodology may differ depending on the specific system and regulatory context, some general principles can guide the rate calculation and adjustment:\n\n1. Cost recovery: The flat rate should be set at a level that allows transmission planners to recover the costs associated with connecting new power generators to the grid, including grid upgrades, maintenance, and expansion projects.\n\n2. Cost causation: The rate should reflect the costs that each generator imposes on the system due to its location, technology, and size. This can be achieved by considering factors such as the distance to existing transmission infrastructure, the expected level of congestion, and the capacity of the generator.\n\n3. Incentives for efficient siting: To encourage power generators to locate their facilities in areas with the least impact on the grid, the flat rate can be adjusted based on location-specific factors. For example, generators located closer to load centers or existing transmission lines might pay a lower flat rate compared to those located in more remote areas with higher grid connection costs.\n\n4.

Generation and Transmission Co-optimization\nThe joint generation and transmission expansion problem is\nformulated as a deterministic linear program that maximizes\nthe total surplus over the course of one year of operations\nafter accounting for an annualized investment cost for both\ngeneration and transmission. Power flow is simplified to a\ntransportation model. Reflecting the declining average costs\ntypical of transmission infrastructure, transmission cost consists of fixed and size-dependent components. While this cost\nstructure generally necessitates a mixed-integer program, we\nmake the assumption that it is always optimal to build some\namount of transmission in the included corridors in the range\nof costs considered, allowing a simplification to the linear\nmodel.\nThe joint generation and transmission expansion problem is\nstated as follows:\n(CEP)\nmaximize\nx,y,z,f,d\nP\ni∈N\nP\nt∈T B(dit − Dit) −\nP\nt∈T\nP\ng∈G C\nEN\ng\nygt\n−\nX\ng∈G\nC\nINV\ng xg −\nX\nl∈L\n(KF\nl + KV\nl\nzl) (1a)\nsubject to\ndit −\nX\ng∈Gi\nygt +\nX\nl∈L\nSilflt = 0 ∀i ∈ N , t ∈ T (1b)\n− zl ≤ flt ≤ zl ∀l ∈ L, t ∈ T (1c)\n0 ≤ ygt ≤ Agtxg ∀g ∈ G, t ∈ T (1d)\n0 ≤ dit ≤ Dit ∀i ∈ N , t ∈ T (1e)\nxg ≥ 0 ∀g ∈ G (1f)\nzl ≥ 0 ∀l ∈ L. (1g)\nWhile formulated as a maximization problem, constants reflecting the value of firm demand and the fixed component of\ntransmission cost are included, allowing the objective function\nin Eq. (1a) to be interpreted as the negative total cost to build\nand operate the system, including the cost of shedding load\nwhen necessary. With the node-arc incidence matrix element\nSil taking the value 1 for a line originating at i, -1 for a line\nterminating at i, and 0 otherwise, Eq. (1b) represents power\nbalance at each node. Equation (1c) enforces maximum flow\non each line in each period, while Eq. (1d) limits generation to\nits available capacity in each period. Lastly, Eq. (1e) constrains\nthe quantity of served load.\nB. Myopic Investment\nIn the myopic case, investors in generation expand capacity\nto an optimal quantity based on the current transmission\ncapacity in the system, while the transmission system planner\nbuilds based on the current generation capacity. Both processes\nare modeled as deterministic linear programs, and the order\nis chosen such that within each cycle generation investment\noccurs before transmission. With z\nk\nl\nrepresenting the capacity\nof line l at the end of investment cycle k ∈ K, the generation\nexpansion problem for cycle k + 1 is stated as follows:\n(GEP)\nmaximize\nx,y,f,d\nX\ni∈N\nX\nt∈T\nB(dit − Dit)\n−\nX\nt∈T\nX\ng∈G\nC\nEN\ng\nygt −\nX\ng∈G\nC\nINV\ng xg (2a)\nsubject to (1b), (1d)–(1f)\n−z\nk\nl ≤ flt ≤ z\nk\nl ∀l ∈ L, t ∈ T .\n(2b)\nWith x\nk\ng\nrepresenting the installed capacity of technology g\nin cycle k, the transmission expansion problem in cycle k is\nstated as follows:\n(T EP)\nmaximize\ny,z,f,d\nX\ni∈N\nX\nt∈T\nB(dit − Dit)\n−\nX\nt∈T\nX\ng∈G\nC\nEN\ng\nygt\n−\nX\nl∈L\n(KF\nl + KV\nl\nzl) (3a)\nsubject to (1b), (1c), (1e), (1g)\n0 ≤ ygt ≤ Agtx\nk\ng ∀g ∈ G, t ∈ T .

Copper Plate Model\nIn the numerical example, the proposed FIR is settled\nagainst the price that would arise in a copper plate system,\ni.e., one without transmission constraints. The copper plate\ndispatch problem given generation capacity xˆ is stated as\nfollows:\n(CU − ED)\nmaximize\ny,d\nX\ni∈N\nX\nt∈T\nB(dit − Dit)\n−\nX\nt∈T\nX\ng∈G\nC\nEN\ng\nygt (5a)\nsubject to X\ni∈N\ndit −\nX\ng∈G\nygt = 0 ∀t ∈ T (5b)\n0 ≤ ygt ≤ Agtxˆg ∀g ∈ G, t ∈ T (5c)\n0 ≤ dit ≤ Dit ∀i ∈ N , t ∈ T . (5d)\nE. Financial Interconnection Rights\nAs defined in this paper, a generator that holds a FIR has an\noption on the difference between the price that would arise in a\ncopper plate model and the spot price at their location, with the\nvolume scaled by the availability of that generator. Along the\nlines of the discussion in [55], this definition is appropriate for\nthe variable renewables driving current issues in interconnection processes; however, alternative definitions of the hedging\ninstrument could be constructed for thermal resources, storage,\nand demand-side resources as appropriate. Letλit indicate the\nprice at node i in time period t, calculated as the dual variable\nto the power balance constraint in model (ED), and let λ\nCU\nt\nindicate the dual variable to the power balance constraint in\nthe copper plate model (CU−ED). Then, the per-MW payout\nrg of a FIR for generator g located at node i is calculated as\nrg =\nX\nt∈T\nAgt max{0, λCU\nt − λit}. (6)\nNote that the volume of the contract is determined by the\navailability of the resource, rather than the amount actually\nproduced in real-time given a potentially suboptimal generation mix or transmission configuration. Accordingly, the\ncontract does not affect dispatch incentives on the margin. For\nthe numerical experiment, the price qg of the instrument per\nMW of installed capacity (i.e., the fixed interconnection fee)\nis calculated as\nqg =\nX\nt∈T\nAgt max{0, λCU∗\nt − λ\n∗\nit}, (7)\nwhere values for λ\n∗\nit are calculated as the dual variables to\nEq. (1b) from model (CEP) and those for λ\nCU∗\nt\nare calculated using model (CU −ED) and the optimal generation mix\nfrom model (CEP). It follows that, with perfect information\nand an optimally configured generation mix and transmission\nsystem, the price and payout of the contract would be precisely\nequal.\nIt is worth highlighting that the definition here relies on the\npresence of full-strength nodal prices for energy. In a system\nwith zonal capacity markets, the hedge would also need to\ninclude the financial component of a CIR. While a CIR grants\nthe right to participate in the capacity market (based on a\ndeliverability assessment performed upon interconnection), an\nFIR would provide a swap on revenues in the capacity market\neven if a unit were deemed non-deliverable in a later, more\naccurate assessment.\nF. Equilibrium Generation Mix\nA long-run competitive equilibrium generation mix for a\ngiven transmission configuration occurs when a) spot prices\nmatch supply and demand at each node in each time period,\ni.e., the short-term market clears, and b) each generation\nresource with non-zero capacity in the system achieves zero\nprofit. Suppose (x\n∗\n, y∗\n, z∗\n, f ∗\n, d∗\n) is an optimal solution to\nmodel (CEP). Then, given the linear programming form of\nmodel (CEP), it is well-known that x\n∗\nis an equilibrium generation mix. Now consider a modified copper-plate generation\nexpansion problem formulated as follows:\n(CU − GEP)\nmaximize\nx,y,d\nP\ni∈N\nP\nt∈T B(dit − Dit) −\nP\nt∈T\nP\ng∈G C\nEN\ng\nygt\n−\nX\ng∈G\n(C\nINV\ng + qg)xg (8a)\nsubject to\nX\ni∈N\ndit −\nX\ng∈G\nygt = 0 ∀t ∈ T (8b)\n0 ≤ ygt ≤ Agtxg ∀g ∈ G, t ∈ T (8c)\n0 ≤ dit ≤ Dit ∀i ∈ N , t ∈ T . (8d)\nComparing to model (GEP), the investment cost C\nINV\ng has\nbeen adjusted by the cost of the FIR, qg, and transmission\nconstraints have been relaxed. As a linear program, prices\nequal to the dual variables associated with Eq. (8b) lead\nto zero profit for all generators in the optimal solution to\nmodel (CU − GEP). Assuming the FIR achieves its goal of\nexchanging operating profits under nodal prices for operating\nprofits that would be obtained in a copper-plate system, payouts from the contract precisely balance the additional charge\nqg, implying that x\n∗\nis also a zero-profit equilibrium under\nthe proposed regime. As a consequence, model (CU −GEP)\ncan be solved to find the equilibrium generation mix that\nwould be obtained with FIRs, and (neglecting complications\nwith multiple optimal primal or dual solutions) this generation\nmix is socially optimal for the socially optimal transmission\nsystem."

        "text": "In recent years, the integration of low-carbon resources, such as renewable energy sources, into power systems has become increasingly important for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. However, this transition also brings new technical challenges in maintaining the security of power systems. In this paper, Billimoria, Mancarella, and Poudineh explore the relationship between the physical and economic aspects of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nThe authors propose a physics-informed approach to classify power system security products and services, revealing two critical findings. Firstly, they demonstrate that these services should not be considered as a homogeneous set of public goods, but rather as a set of products/services (basket of goods) with both public and private characteristics. This distinction is important because it has implications for the design of market and regulatory frameworks that govern the provision and consumption of these services.\n\nSecondly, the framework suggests that many new system services can be characterized as common pool resources. This means that they are shared resources that are available to multiple users, but their use by one individual may deplete the availability of the resource for others. As a result, there is a need for more localized network planning and coordination of access and service provision to efficiently manage these resources.\n\nThe paper highlights the importance of considering both the physical and economic dimensions of power system security when designing market and regulatory frameworks for low-carbon electricity systems. This can help ensure that the transition to cleaner energy sources does not compromise the reliability and security of power grids, while also promoting efficient allocation of resources and minimizing costs for consumers.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of low-carbon resources into power systems requires a rethinking of the way security products and services are classified and managed. By considering both the physical and economic aspects of power system security, policy-makers and regulators can design more effective frameworks that promote the efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems."

That is, in our case,\nhow is power system security appropriated and who are\nthe appropriators?\nA helpful analogy is to think of power system security\nas analogous to water quality [17]. As described in the\nvalue chain, ESS provides a secure physical system\nenvelope within which the generation and consumption\nof energy can occur. As such all power system users,\nboth generators and consumers, are consumers of the\nrelevant services essential for system security (ESS),\nas all benefit from a stable grid that facilitates trade\nin energy. Generators also directly benefit from system\nsecurity, as an insecure and unstable grid could result in\nmore frequent unit tripping and equipment damage [44].\nTherefore, as Cowen [11] describes in the context of club\ngoods, we can say that ‘an additional membership would\nreally amount to an additional consumption unit’. As the\nbeneficiaries of operational security are quite diverse,\nthis means it can be more difficult in determining\nhow much a new user affects operational security. For\nexample, a new user could be one that contributes to\nor detracts from system security depending upon the\nspecific technology and control system used. Thankfully,\nthis is a challenge not unique to electricity, and one\npossible approach is to determine whether there are\nclasses of users more likely connect in a certain area\n[17, 50] (e.g. wind and solar tend have tended locate in\nmore remote and weaker parts of the grid).\nStep 2: excludability\nThe characteristic of excludability is analysed in the second stage. Can a system service be physically excluded\nfrom a user? For many system services, users cannot be\nnaturally excluded from enjoying the value of the services in a power system. For example, all resources benefit from frequency and voltage stability in the system\n[43, 54]. Alternately, if a user can be curtailed (such as,\ne.g. with products allowing for differentiated reliability),\nthen the service can be considered excludable.\nStep 3: subtractability and jointness of use\nThe third step involves an assessment of subtractability.\nThe marginal cost of extension is an applicable concept for assessing subtractability, defined as the cost\nof extending a good or service to a new beneficiary or\nuser [50]. Goods that are subtractable by definition will\nhave a positive marginal cost of extension. Most goods\nare somewhat subtractable [21, 54]. The policy question\nis, ‘Is it significant enough to reframe the allocation of\nproperty rights?’ Note S1 sets out the formulation for\nthe assessment of subtractability for a variety of ESS by\nexamining the impact on the marginal cost of extension.\nStep 4: transformation\nIn the final stage, we consider the potential for transformation of the service.

Illustrative system for system strength characterization analysis, involving a PEC resource connected via an infinite bus to synchronous\nresources\ntime and region and ref lecting the system of property\nrights currently in place. Transformation of goods can\noccur based on the framework of laws and regulation\nin place, and any market frameworks [10]. For example, in the NEM, new regulations for system strength\nintroduce requirements for grid-following PEC resources\nto contribute to system strength network augmentation via connection charges, which reduce the degree\nof subtractability of the service [1]. Policy makers need\nto consider the impact of existing and proposed policy\nframeworks on economic characterization.\nRESULTS\nCASE STUDY: SYSTEM STRENGTH AND\nFAULT LEVELS IN WEAK GRIDS\nSystem strength is an emerging challenge in regions\nwith high inverter-based penetration. For a weak grid,\nthe voltage exhibits sensitivity to variation in active or\nreactive power [19]. Strong grids have stiff voltages which\nare resilient to disturbances. The strength of the system\nis an outcome of various factors, but historically synchronous units have been a strong contributor to system\nstrength. The first generation of PEC resources (using\nphase-locked loop controls) requires a strong grid to\noperate and have small contributions to system strength\n[19], thereby requiring contributions from online synchronous generators [27]. New advanced ‘grid forming’\ninverter technology can allow inverter-based resources to\nmeaningfully contribute to system strength. Weak grids\nare susceptible to instability and can result in failure of\nfault-protection and inverter control systems [19], voltage oscillations [40] and angular instability [52].\nStatic and quasi-static metrics provide high-level\nscreening for system strength impacts, including variations on the classical short circuit ratio and the available\nfault level (AFL) [2, 9]. Small-signal analysis methods\nare also an increasingly common approach. System\noperators are also increasingly undertaking computationally intensive electromagnetic transient simulations\nto understand what combinations of resources create\nstrong or weak grids [9].\nShort-term but less undesirable fixes to managing system strength issues have involved out of merit dispatch\nof synchronous generation. Network augmentation of\nsynchronous condensers [19, 45] and inverter tuning are\nlonger term alternatives, along with the increased piloting and deployment of grid-forming inverters [27].\nIn providing a conceptual understanding of the\neconomic characterization of system strength, we focus\nupon fault level as the key factor and use the associated\nmetric of AFL at a node [9]. However, it should be noted\nthis represents a simplification of a highly dynamic,\ncomplex and evolving system phenomena. As such, this\nexample is not intended to reveal a final characterization\nbut an indication of the key sensitivities. As AFL has been\nconsidered and implemented as a high-level planning\nmetric in certain markets [19] and is widely used in\ntechnical analysis [9], we gain a degree of comfort that its\nuse here conveys a reasonable conceptual understanding\nof the dynamic phenomena. However, a system dynamics\nanalysis would be required case by case to understand\nthe true physical interactions of different factors. A\ndynamics analysis could then be readily coupled with\nstatic metrics as an extension to this formulation as part\nof future work.\nIn this case, we consider an example adapted from\nCIGRE [9], shown in Fig. 3, showing the connection of\na PEC resource such as a wind farm to an infinite bus.\nFault level contributions are provided by synchronous\nresources within the infinite bus. Under the original\nCIGRE analysis, a synchronous unit is assumed able to\nprovide the full system strength contribution (in terms\nof fault current) that was required.\nThe AFL at the connection point is calculated as the\ndifference between the fault level provided by the synchronous resources and the fault level required by the\nPEC resource.\nAFL = Fprov − Freq > AFLmin. (1)\nFollowing the steps in CIGRE [9], and assuming fully\nreactive impedances, using Kirchhoff’s law, the contribution to fault or short circuit level caused by the SG is\ndetermined (as per (12)), where CMVA\nSG is the rated capacity\nof the synchronous unit in MegaVolt–Amperes (MVA),\nV is the voltage (on a per unit basis) at the node (which\nis assumed as 1.0), Zn is the network impedance (per\nunit) and Zi the internal (sub-transient) impedance of the\nsynchronous unit (per unit):\nFprov = CMVA\nSC × V2\nZn + Zi\n.

Depletion of fault levels through the addition of new PEC resource, illustrating the congestible nature of fault levels as an economic good.\nSource: Adapted from AEMO [2].\nThe needed fault level for the existing PEC resource is\nbased upon its minimum short circuit ratio rating and\nthe rated capacity of the PEC resource CMW\nPEC is calculated\nas\nFreq = MSCR × CMW\nPEC . (3)\nSubtractability here is assessed using the marginal\ncost of extension focussing upon outage costs and based\nupon the AFL as a relevant metric:\nmce ∼= δco (AFLmin − AFL)\nδp . (4)\nWhen the AFL is high, the addition of a new generator does not affect system strength as such. However,\nwhen AFL is low, the inclusion of a new generator can\ndeplete the available AFL capacity to a great extent. In a\nnetwork with such fault levels, a new user that is added\nat this location would essentially connect to a system\nthat has a zero AFL; thus, it is likely to increase the risk\nof system instability and consequently its outage costs.\nThis indicates that fault levels become subtractable to\nan increasing extent as the network gets congested more\nand more, suggestive of features that are compatible\nwith the definition of a congestible CPR. Finally, we note\nthat the characteristics of the user affect the marginal\ncost. A lower mce would apply to users that are less\nreliant upon a stiff system (e.g. through a lower minimum\nshort circuit ratio) or to users that actually contribute to\nsystem strength (such as through grid-formation).\nConsider a numerical example in the above system,\nwhere V = 1 per unit, Zn = 0.08j per unit, Zi = 0.02j per\nunit,AFLmin = 0 MVA and fault level contribution CMVA\nSC of\n100 MVA. In an uncongested system with CMW\nPEC =300 and\nMSCR = 2.0, the AFL would be 400 MVA, well above\nthe minimum level. In such a scenario, the effect of an\nincremental MW would be negligible, as AFLs would\nstill be high. However, in a congested system where\nCMW\nPEC = 500 MW, this resource would deplete all AFL\n(AFL = 0MVA). In such a scenario, the impacts of an\nincremental MW would be significant as the AFL would\nfall below the threshold. This, however, assumes that the\nincremental MW relies upon stiff voltages provided by\nfault current.\nAlternately, if the incremental user addition is required\n(e.g. by the regulatory regime) to have grid-forming capability (and assuming technical viability), it would not\nrely upon local fault levels and potentially add to the\nstability of the system. This indicates the importance of\nunderstanding user characteristics.\nA further practical application of the above framework\nis provided in AEMO [2]. Figure 4 illustrates the impact\nof a new inverter-based generator in the network in the\nstate of Tasmania (which is a part of the NEM of Australia). The figure illustrates that the addition of the PEC\nresource depletes at particular nodes, such as N3 the AFL.\nExcess fault levels remain at other nodes and as such the\naddition of this resource would not be a cause a concern\n(this includes nodes such as N4 and N5). Illustrative of\nfault levels being more rival at places where the grid is\ncongested; this is supportive of treating this electricity\nsystem service as a CCPR."

We assess four classes of ESS comprising\ninertia and frequency response, voltage control, system\nstrength and differentiated reliability.\nDifferentiated reliability is a class of products offering\ndifferential electric service quality or priority [6]. The\nconcept of differential reliability encompasses a scheme\nfor the supply of electricity based on priority service [35].\nPriority service offers consumers choices from a menu of\nreliability differentiated service options. Customers can\nchoose to allocate different plans to strips of power (i.e.\nsuch as different devices), based on essentiality of use.\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ooenergy/article/doi/10.1093/ooenergy/oiac007/6652147 by guest on 09 May 2023\nBillimoria et al. | 9\nTable 2.

Services like inertia and frequency response have limited subtractability and strong\npublic good characteristics while others, like fault levels\nand voltage control products,might be more subtractable\nespecially in the face of congestion. This suggests that\nthe CPR classification is more relevant. Further, heterogeneity is observed when examining differentiated reliability products, a class of products offering differential\nelectric service quality or priority [6]. In such cases, consumers can be curtailed from electric service dependent\nupon the service level being subscribed. This suggests\nthat the service is excludable. These products are also\nrival because they relate to the consumption of a finite\nsupply of energy at each interval. This implies a private\ngoods characterization of such products.\nThese characteristics may also be transformed through\nindustry regulation and/or technology advancement. For\nexample, grid codes requiring advanced stability control\nsystems (e.g. over-voltage or under-voltage automatic\ndisconnection) for PEC resources may reduce the reliance\nupon grid strength as the resources themselves become\ninherently stronger and more resilient.\nThe ‘basket of goods’ characterization has important\nimplications for market design including the following.\n• Common pool characterizations of goods are increasingly relevant and highlight the importance of\nadaptive governance approaches that cater more\nspecifically to local network topologies, user characteristics and conditions [39]. Particular aspects\nof CPR management that are important to power\nsystem security include (i) local co-ordination and\ncooperation (with potentially better siting and sizing\nof system resources); (ii) the use of graduated sanctions, though constraint management for instance, to\nincentivize good ‘user and provider’ behaviour; and\n(iii) the need for f lexible and tailored solutions rather\nthan large scale, homogenized ‘commodification’\n[51].\n• The inseparability of products with different economic characterizations. The provision of inertia\n(public good) and system strength (congestible\nCPR) by a synchronous generator, for instance, are\ninseparable. The approach to the procurement of one\ngood will thus affect the other, with consequences\nthat are nontrivial to handle from an economic\nperspective.\n• Frameworks for market access and curtailment.\nIt is also relevant to examine the framework of\nconnection right and access to the grid. For example,\nmany of the control systems that impact upon\npower system security can be regulated through the\nconnection approvals process [19]. This may ensure\nthat new users make some form of contribution\nto the ‘common pool’. In certain jurisdictions, this\nhas also required new investment in plant such\nas synchronous condensers to mitigate any harm\ncaused to system security from the connection.\nSecondly, access regimes can also govern the rights\nand obligations of new connections with respect to\ncurtailment, with firmer regimes providing stronger\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ooenergy/article/doi/10.1093/ooenergy/oiac007/6652147 by guest on 09 May 2023\n10 | Oxford Open Energy, 2022, Vol. 1, No. 1\nFigure 5.

Striking the right\nbalance between access rights, technical mandates\nand market mechanisms is a difficult regulatory task.\n• Incentives for investment. While investment in system security assets can arise from the network connection process, it can also be facilitated by a centralized process. A central process could allow goods\nto be procured together (such as system strength\nand inertia). This could provide rationale for buying ‘super-products’—where several products can be\naggregated and procured together. The recent Stability Pathfinder procurement by National Grid [36] is an\nexample of this. An important question is therefore\nthe terms of procurement. While spot markets can\ncreate scarcity signals, it is questionable whether\nthey are able to drive investment in the absence of\nrivalry and incentives for risk hedging [41]. In contrast\nto the energy spot markets where volatile prices can\ndrive contracting, many products are non-rival that\nencourages free-riding and dampens the incentive\nfor contracting. While this may be practically justifiable for services that represent a small portion of\ngenerators’ existing energy revenue base, it is less so\nwhere the investment justification for new assets is\nhighly dependent on revenues from the delivery of\nsystem services (such as battery storage). This might\nbecome crucial for balancing and reserve services as\nzero-marginal cost resources increasingly dominate\nthe market. In these circumstances, in addition to\nshort-term markets, a long-term centralized (public)\nprocurement programme may be required.\nDISCUSSION\nEMERGING DESIGN MODELS FOR\nOPERATIONAL SECURITY\nMarket and regulatory designs need to be sufficiently\nnuanced to deal with the techno-economic complexity\nof ESSs. We summarize, in Table 3, five canonical models\nof design for system services developed with a mind\nto the following principles: (i) design suited to the\neconomic characteristics of underlying system security\ngoods; (ii) consistency between access frameworks,\nmarkets and agency incentives; (iii) the objective of\nincentive-compatibility weighted against; (iv) design\ncomplexity and practicality; and (v) the capability to\naddress emerging technologies, stakeholders and market\narchitectures discussions (such as increased distributed\nenergy resource proliferation or the growth of multienergy systems). A description of the canonical designs\nfollows in Note S3 (with architectures illustrated in\nFigs S3.1 and S3.4).\nIn the centralized procurement model, responsibility\nfor the management of system security is designated to\none or more central agencies, on a short as well as longterm basis. Critical to success of this model is the need for\nsystem-wide renewable integration objectives that guide\nthe central agencies and form a basis for their incentives.\nIn this system, the central agency must be motivated\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ooenergy/article/doi/10.1093/ooenergy/oiac007/6652147 by guest on 09 May 2023\nBillimoria et al. | 11\nTable 3.

Regulation\nmay be required to guide central agency decision\nmaking, perhaps combined with innovative performance\nmanagement frameworks [22]. The centralized approach\nis well suited to public goods. CPR system services could\nalso be incorporated under a centralized framework,\nbut consideration needs to be given to how the service\nis allocated during scarcity. Access frameworks and\nrenewable integration objectives would also need to\nsupport this.\nDecentralized approaches can incentivize investment\nthrough cost or quantity allocations to market participants or through the network connection process itself.\nWhile this offers the efficiencies and innovation that\nmarket-driven contracting and investment can bring, it is\ncritical to appropriately specify the quantity and quality\nrequirements of the relevant system services. This may\nbe difficult for less definable and measurable system\nservices (such as system strength). In some cases, the\nemergence of new technical issues could result in underprocurement and may leave the system vulnerable.\nTo mitigate this challenge, hybrid regimes can establish strong grid standards but with backstop measures to\ndeal with larger risks. This procurement can be funded\nin whole or part by charges levied on new resources\nconnecting to the network. Such approaches help a central party to integrate long-term system planning and\ninvestment with the connection regime. This is more\ncomplex in a market in which generation resources entry\nand exit are totally unregulated and as such may require\na structured and regionally co-ordinated approach to\nconnections and access.\nFinally, we also propose a hybrid model underpinned\nby locally facilitated co-ordination (Fig. 6). The key\nconcept here is that local platforms are established\nto facilitate co-ordination and collective action. These\nplatforms offer local planning and aggregated grid\nconnection access, as well as matching services between\nresources that are becoming connected and providers.\nThis idea is inherent in regional renewable energy zone\nframeworks in ERCOT region and the NEM of Australia\n[3]. In this model, instead of system-wide renewable\nelectricity targets, the governments and power system\nplanner would approach the issue of renewable integration more on a strategic basis such that a greater focus\nis placed on regional features. This further incentivizes\npartnerships between government and industry to\nfacilitate co-ordinated renewable expansion. Finally, this\nhybrid approach is also suited to emergent distributed\nenergy marketplaces [8], distributed energy resource\ntechnical and commercial aggregation schemes such as\ncommunity energy systems, microgrid and virtual power\nplants based on multi-energy system f lexibility [29], and\nconsumer-centric economic arrangements such as based\non peer-to-peer trading [34].\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ooenergy/article/doi/10.1093/ooenergy/oiac007/6652147 by guest on 09 May 2023\n12 | Oxford Open Energy, 2022, Vol. 1, No. 1\nFigure 6. Hybrid centralized–decentralized model underpinned by locally facilitated co-ordination.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe management of operation security in an inverter\ndominated grid poses a new set of challenges for system\noperators and market designers calling for a reintegration of economic frameworks with our evolving understanding of the system’s new physics. In this paper, we\nhave assessed the key technical challenges for managing\nsecurity and provided a framework for the economic\ncharacterization of the technical goods that a power\nsystem may need.\nThere are five key messages that are an outcome\nof this analysis. First, security in low-carbon power\nsystems is a technically complex topic. The transition to\nsynchronously decoupled technology introduces neverbefore seen technical scarcities (such as inertia and\nsystem strength). Power system parameters are also\nincreasingly interactive, uncertain and unpredictable—\nwith potential not only for co-optimization but also\nundesired cross-service effects. While new technology\nhas the potential to offer solutions, it requires regulatory\nand/or market incentives to implement. New operational\nmechanisms also need to be put in place to incentivize\noptimal solutions and identify true trade-offs. Second,\nthe economics of power system security are just as, if\nnot more, complex and intricate involving a multitude of\ngrid services with differing characteristics. The technical\ncomplexity of such services translates to heterogenous\neconomic characterizations—‘a basket of goods’. In\nparticular, a range of services essential for the future grid\ndisplay the characteristics of congestible CPRs necessitating a nuanced and localized approach to regulatory\ndesign. Third, a failure to link technical requirements to\neconomics risks incentive-incompatible market design.\nFourth, a bottom-up ‘physics-to-economics’ approach\nis required to appropriately characterize the economic\ncharacteristics of new security services, and market\ndesign must ref lect these characteristics. Finally, five\ncanonical market designs are presented that vary from\ncentralized procurement, to decentralized approaches\nand hybrid models that aim to bridge between central\nand localized provision of services."

Each design has its unique approach to quantification of services, procurement responsibility, character of goods, renewable objectives, access frameworks, and operational scheduling/dispatch. Here's an in-depth look at each market design:\n\n1. Centralized procurement: In this model, responsibility for managing system security is designated to one or more central agencies, both short-term and long-term. The central agency must be motivated to make efficient decisions around procurement and anticipate future needs. This design is well-suited for public goods and common pool resources (CPRs) if managed properly. Access frameworks and renewable integration objectives need to support this model.\n\n2. Decentralized procurement via cost or quantity allocations: In this design, investment incentives are provided through cost or quantity allocations to market participants. While this approach can bring market-driven efficiencies and innovation, specifying the quantity and quality requirements of the relevant system services may be challenging, especially for less definable and measurable services. This might result in under-procurement, leaving the system vulnerable.\n\n3. Decentralized procurement via network access: In this model, procurement occurs through the network connection process itself. While this can incentivize investment, it may lead to suboptimal outcomes if the connection process doesn't consider the overall system needs. Striking the right balance between access rights, technical mandates, and market mechanisms is a difficult regulatory task in this design.\n\n4. Hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement: This design combines strong grid standards with backstop measures to deal with larger risks. Procurement can be funded in whole or part by charges levied on new resources connecting to the network. This approach helps integrate long-term system planning and investment with the connection regime, which is more complex in a market where generation resources entry and exit are unregulated.\n\n5. Decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination: In this hybrid model, local platforms are established to facilitate coordination and collective action. These platforms offer local planning, aggregated grid connection access, and matching services between resources and providers. This design is well-suited for emergent distributed energy marketplaces, distributed energy resource technical and commercial aggregation schemes, and consumer-centric economic arrangements such as peer-to-peer trading.\n\nThe economics of these market designs hinge upon the classification of power system security products and services as a set of goods with varying public and private characteristics. The designs aim to balance efficiency, security, and investment incentives while taking into account the complex technical and economic aspects of the power system. The choice of a suitable market design depends on the specific context, characteristics of the power system, and the goals and objectives of policymakers and regulators."

        "text": "The five canonical market designs for operational security in low-carbon power systems address the challenges of integrating low-carbon resources while maintaining power system security. Each design has its own unique features, advantages, and drawbacks. Here, we provide a more in-depth analysis of each of these designs and their implications on the economics of power system security.\n\n1. Centralized procurement: In this model, a central agency is responsible for managing system security on both short and long-term basis. The central agency needs to be motivated to make efficient decisions around procurement and anticipate future needs of the system. This design is well suited for public goods and common pool resources (CPR) system services. However, it requires clear system-wide renewable integration objectives and appropriate regulation to guide the central agency's decision-making.\n\nEconomically, centralized procurement can help achieve economies of scale, reduce transaction costs, and ensure the provision of public goods. However, it may not always lead to the most efficient allocation of resources, as it relies on the central agency's ability to predict future needs and market conditions accurately.\n\n2. Decentralized procurement via cost or quantity allocations: In this model, market participants are incentivized to invest in system security through cost or quantity allocations. While this design allows for more market-driven contracting and investment, specifying the quantity and quality requirements for system services can be challenging. This may lead to under-procurement and leave the system vulnerable to new technical issues.\n\nEconomically, decentralized procurement encourages innovation and competition among market participants. However, it may fail to provide adequate system security if the quantity and quality requirements are not appropriately specified.\n\n3. Decentralized procurement via network access: This design procures system security services through the network connection process. It requires strong grid standards and backstop measures to deal with larger risks. Procurement can be funded in part by charges levied on new resources connecting to the network, allowing for more integration between long-term system planning and investment with the connection regime.\n\nEconomically, this design can create incentives for market participants to invest in system security while maintaining a more decentralized approach. However, it can be complex to implement, especially in markets where generation resources entry and exit are unregulated.\n\n4. Hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement: This model combines features of both centralized and decentralized procurement, aiming to strike a balance between the efficiency of market-driven investment and the need for central planning to ensure system security. It can involve a central agency procuring some services while leaving others to be procured by market participants.\n\nEconomically, the hybrid approach can benefit from the advantages of both centralized and decentralized procurement. It can enable market-driven innovation while ensuring adequate system security through central planning and coordination.\n\n5. Decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination: This design is based on locally facilitated coordination, where local platforms are established to facilitate cooperation and collective action. These platforms can offer local planning, aggregated grid connection access, and matching services between resources and providers. This approach is well suited for emergent distributed energy marketplaces, distributed energy resource aggregation schemes, and consumer-centric economic arrangements.\n\nEconomically, this design can promote regional cooperation and coordination, allowing for more tailored solutions that account for local network topologies and user characteristics. However, it may require more complex coordination mechanisms and rely on the willingness of market participants to collaborate effectively.\n\nIn summary, each of the five canonical market designs has its own strengths and weaknesses in addressing the technical and economic challenges of power system security in low-carbon electricity systems. The choice of the most suitable design depends on the specific context, characteristics of the power system, and the objectives of policy-makers and regulators."

Introduce the market designs, evaluate their characteristics using each model, sumarize the benefits and drawbacks and finnaly asign a final rating.\n\nSUMARY:\nThe authors of the paper present a case study on system strength and fault levels in weak grids, which are becoming an emerging challenge in regions with high inverter-based penetration. They use the metric of available fault level (AFL) as a key factor to provide a conceptual understanding of the economic characterization of system strength, although they acknowledge that this is a simplification of a highly complex and dynamic system.\n\n\nThe case study follows a four-step process:\n\n\nProduct appropriation and appropriators: Identifying how power system security is consumed and who the consumers are. In this case, both generators and consumers of electricity benefit from a stable grid that facilitates energy trade.\n\nExcludability: Determining whether a system service can be physically excluded from a user. For many system services, users cannot be naturally excluded, while some services can be considered excludable if a user can be curtailed.\n\nSubtractability and jointness of use: Assessing the marginal cost of extension, which is the cost of extending a good or service to a new beneficiary or user. Goods that are subtractable have a positive marginal cost of extension.\n\nTransformation: Considering the potential for the transformation of the service based on the framework of laws and regulations in place, and any market frameworks.\n\n\nThe case study illustrates that fault levels become increasingly subtractable as the network gets more congested, suggesting features that are compatible with the definition of a congestible common pool resource (CPR). This highlights the importance of understanding user characteristics when considering the impact of an incremental addition to the grid.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the case study demonstrates the practical application of the proposed framework for the economic characterization of power system security goods. By considering factors such as excludability, subtractability, and transformation, policy-makers and regulators can better understand the dynamics of power system security in weak grids and design more effective market and regulatory frameworks for low-carbon electricity systems."

        "text": "A low-carbon resource refers to an energy source that produces minimal or significantly reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), when compared to traditional fossil fuel-based energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Low-carbon resources are essential in mitigating climate change and transitioning to a more sustainable energy system.\n\nExamples of low-carbon resources include:\n\n1. Renewable energy sources: These are naturally replenished and include solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. They generate electricity with little to no greenhouse gas emissions during their operation.\n\n2. Nuclear power: Although not a renewable resource, nuclear power produces low levels of carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels. It relies on nuclear reactions to generate heat, which is then used to produce electricity.\n\n3. Carbon capture and storage (CCS): This technology captures carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial processes and stores them safely underground, preventing them from being released into the atmosphere. While not an energy source itself, CCS can be applied to fossil fuel-based power generation, effectively lowering its carbon emissions.\n\n4. Energy efficiency measures: Improving energy efficiency in various sectors, such as buildings, transportation, and industry, can effectively reduce overall carbon emissions by consuming less energy while maintaining the same level of service or output.\n\nLow-carbon resources play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a more sustainable, environmentally friendly energy system to combat climate change."

The authors of the paper propose a physics-informed approach to classify power system security products and services, identifying five canonical market designs to address these challenges: centralized procurement, decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation, decentralized procurement via network access, hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement, and decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination. This report evaluates each market design using the given models, summarizing their benefits, drawbacks, and assigning a final rating.\n\n\nCentralized Procurement:\nCentralized procurement designates responsibility for system security to one or more central agencies. This design is well-suited for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP), as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously.

Centralized procurement is one of the market designs proposed to address these challenges. This report focuses on the benefits and drawbacks of centralized procurement for operational security in low-carbon power systems, particularly in the context of the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP), Generation Expansion Problem (GEP), and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models.\n\n1. Introduction:\nPower system security is essential for maintaining the stability and reliability of electricity grids, especially as the integration of low-carbon resources increases. Centralized procurement designates responsibility for system security to one or more central agencies, which coordinate the procurement of essential system security services. This report examines the performance of centralized procurement in the context of the CEP, GEP, and TEP models, highlighting its benefits and drawbacks.\n\n2. Centralized Procurement Overview:\nCentralized procurement involves a central agency or organization responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. This central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is well-suited for the CEP model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.\n\n3. Benefits of Centralized Procurement:\n\n- Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.\n- Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.\n- Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.\n\n4. Drawbacks of Centralized Procurement:\n\n- Less effective in GEP and TEP models: Centralized procurement may not be as effective in the GEP and TEP models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination. In these cases, decentralized procurement may be more suitable.\n- Potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency: Centralized procurement may introduce bureaucratic hurdles and potential inefficiencies, as decisions must be made by a central authority rather than individual market participants.\n\n5. Conclusion:\nCentralized procurement offers several benefits for operational security in low-carbon power systems, particularly in the context of the CEP model. However, its effectiveness may be limited in the GEP and TEP models due to a lack of centralized coordination. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between centralized and decentralized procurement models to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems."

Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is one of the market designs proposed to address these challenges. This report examines the decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design, evaluating its benefits, drawbacks, and suitability for different models in low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe transition to low-carbon power systems necessitates a rethinking of market and regulatory frameworks that govern the provision and consumption of power system security services. Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This design aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nBenefits of Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation:\n\n1. Market-driven investment decisions: This design encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.\n\n2. Incentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.\n\n3. Better suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.\n\nDrawbacks of Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation:\n\n1. Lack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.\n\n2. Potential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.\n\n3. Complexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.\n\nSuitability for Different Models:\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\nConclusion:\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation offers certain benefits, such as market-driven investment decisions and incentives for innovation, but also has drawbacks, such as lack of centralized coordination and potential for underinvestment in system security. It is better suited for GEP and TEP models and may not be ideal for the CEP model. Policymakers and regulators need to carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems."

This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.\n\n2. Encourages Competition and Innovation: By allowing multiple connecting resources to participate in the procurement of system security services, Decentralized Procurement via Network Access fosters competition and innovation in the market. This can result in the development of more effective and cost-efficient solutions for maintaining system security.\n\n3.

The lack of centralized coordination in this market design may limit its ability to address system security challenges effectively in such scenarios.\n\n2. Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.\n\nConclusion:\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required.

Dont write the report just give me the outline:\n\nTitle: Centralized Procurement for Operational Security in Low-Carbon Power Systems\n\nTitle: Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation in Low-Carbon Power Systems\n\n\nExecutive Summary:\nThe integration of low-carbon resources into power systems presents significant challenges for maintaining power system security. Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is one of the market designs proposed to address these challenges. This report examines the decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design, evaluating its benefits, drawbacks, and suitability for different models in low-carbon electricity systems.\n\n\nIntroduction:\nThe transition to low-carbon power systems necessitates a rethinking of market and regulatory frameworks that govern the provision and consumption of power system security services. Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This design aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\n\nBenefits of Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation:\n\n\nMarket-driven investment decisions: This design encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.\n\nIncentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.\n\nBetter suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.\n\n\nDrawbacks of Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation:\n\n\nLack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.\n\nPotential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.\n\nComplexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.\n\n\nSuitability for Different Models:\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\n\nConclusion:\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation offers certain benefits, such as market-driven investment decisions and incentives for innovation, but also has drawbacks, such as lack of centralized coordination and potential for underinvestment in system security. It is better suited for GEP and TEP models and may not be ideal for the CEP model. Policymakers and regulators need to carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nTitle: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access for Operational Security in Low-Carbon Power Systems\n\nExecutive Summary:\nThe integration of low-carbon resources into power systems presents significant challenges for maintaining power system security. This report focuses on Decentralized Procurement via Network Access, a market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources. This approach may be better suited for the Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) and Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) models, as it allows resources to make investments based on local conditions and constraints. However, it may not be as effective under the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model due to the lack of centralized coordination.\n\nIntroduction:\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that shifts the responsibility for procuring system security services from central agencies to individual connecting resources. This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.\n\n2. Encourages Competition and Innovation: By allowing multiple connecting resources to participate in the procurement of system security services, Decentralized Procurement via Network Access fosters competition and innovation in the market. This can result in the development of more effective and cost-efficient solutions for maintaining system security.\n\n3. Better Suited for TEP and GEP Models: This market design may be more effective under the TEP and GEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. This enables connecting resources to address system security challenges in a more targeted manner.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n1. Lack of Centralized Coordination: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access may not be as effective under the CEP model, which requires joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The lack of centralized coordination in this market design may limit its ability to address system security challenges effectively in such scenarios.\n\n2. Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.\n\nConclusion:\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nTitle: Exploring Hybrid Centralized-Decentralized Procurement for Operational Security in Low-Carbon Power Systems\n\n\nExecutive Summary:\nThe integration of low-carbon resources into power systems has significant implications for power system security.

        "text": "III. Centralized Procurement\nA. Overview\n\nCentralized procurement is a market design in which one or more central agencies are responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. The central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.\n2. Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.\n3. Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Less effective in GEP and TEP models: Centralized procurement may not be as effective in the GEP and TEP models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination. In these cases, decentralized procurement may be more suitable.\n2. Potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency: Centralized procurement may introduce bureaucratic hurdles and potential inefficiencies, as decisions must be made by a central authority rather than individual market participants.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nAs a market design, centralized procurement is best suited for the CEP model, where joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is crucial for maintaining operational security in low-carbon power systems. However, for the GEP and TEP models, where decentralized coordination may be more effective, other market designs might be better suited. Policymakers and regulators should consider the specific characteristics of their power systems when selecting a market design for operational security."

        "text": "IV. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This approach aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Market-driven investment decisions: Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.\n\n2. Incentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.\n\n3. Better suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.\n\n2. Potential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.\n\n3. Complexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.\n\nD. Suitability for Different Models\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities."

Overview\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources. This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.\n\n2. Encourages Competition and Innovation: By allowing multiple connecting resources to participate in the procurement of system security services, Decentralized Procurement via Network Access fosters competition and innovation in the market. This can result in the development of more effective and cost-efficient solutions for maintaining system security.\n\n3. Better Suited for TEP and GEP Models: This market design may be more effective under the TEP and GEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. This enables connecting resources to address system security challenges in a more targeted manner.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of Centralized Coordination: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access may not be as effective under the CEP model, which requires joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The lack of centralized coordination in this market design may limit its ability to address system security challenges effectively in such scenarios.\n\n2. Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required. This market design is better suited for the TEP and GEP models, where it allows resources to make investments based on local conditions and constraints. In contrast, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the lack of centralized coordination. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems."

Background on low-carbon power systems\nB. Importance of operational security\nC. Overview of market designs\n\nIII. Centralized Procurement\nA. Overview\n\nCentralized procurement is a market design in which one or more central agencies are responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. The central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.\n2. Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.\n3. Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Less effective in GEP and TEP models: Centralized procurement may not be as effective in the GEP and TEP models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination.

Recommendations for policymakers and regulators:\n\nI. Executive Summary\n\nThe integration of low-carbon resources into power systems presents significant technical and economic challenges for maintaining operational security. This report evaluates five canonical market designs to address these challenges: centralized procurement, decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation, decentralized procurement via network access, hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement, and decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination. Each market design has its unique benefits and drawbacks, making them more or less suitable for different models and scenarios.\n\nCentralized procurement and decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation both receive a final rating of 3/5, as they are less effective in certain models due to their lack of centralized or decentralized coordination. Decentralized procurement via network access also receives a final rating of 3/5, as it is better suited for the Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) and Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) models but not as effective under the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model. Hybrid centralized-decentralized procurement and decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination both receive a final rating of 4/5, as they offer more flexibility and balance between centralized and decentralized decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs for operational security in low-carbon power systems. Decentralized procurement with facilitated coordination, as a hybrid market design, offers a flexible and adaptable approach to address these challenges in various scenarios and contexts. By establishing local platforms for coordination and collective action, this design promotes efficient resource allocation and supports complex common pool resources and coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nII. Introduction\nA. Background on low-carbon power systems\nLow-carbon power systems aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change by incorporating renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower, as well as energy storage and demand-side management technologies. These systems require a rethinking of conventional power system planning and operation due to the intermittent and distributed nature of renewable energy sources, changing demand patterns, and the need to decarbonize the electricity sector.\n\nB. Importance of operational security\nOperational security is essential for maintaining the reliability, stability, and quality of power systems. It involves ensuring the continuous balance between electricity supply and demand, managing grid congestion, and maintaining voltage and frequency within acceptable limits. As low-carbon resources are integrated into the grid, maintaining operational security becomes increasingly complex due to the variability and uncertainty of renewable generation, the need for flexible resources, and the interactions between transmission and distribution systems. Addressing these challenges requires innovative market designs, regulatory frameworks, and coordination mechanisms that can efficiently allocate resources and ensure system security while promoting the integration of low-carbon resources.\n\nC. Overview of market designs\nThis report provides a comprehensive evaluation of five canonical market designs tailored to address the challenges of operational security in low-carbon power systems:\n\n1. Centralized Procurement: A market design where a central authority is responsible for procuring system security services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\n2. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation: This market design relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities, promoting market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation.\n\n3. Decentralized Procurement via Network Access: A market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources, promoting market-driven investment decisions while addressing power system security challenges in low-carbon grids.\n\n4. Hybrid Centralized-Decentralized Procurement: This market design combines elements of centralized and decentralized procurement, allowing for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities while still providing flexibility for local decision-making.\n\n5. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination: A hybrid market design that combines decentralized decision-making with coordinated efforts through local platforms, allowing for local coordination and investment decisions while still promoting overall system security, making it suitable for managing complex common pool resources and promoting coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nEach market design has unique benefits and drawbacks, making them more or less suitable for different models and scenarios. The report examines these market designs in detail, assessing their suitability for various power system models, including Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP), Generation Expansion Problem (GEP), and Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) models. It also provides insights and recommendations for policymakers and regulators to consider when selecting a market design for operational security in low-carbon power systems.\n\nIII. Centralized Procurement\nA. Overview\n\nCentralized procurement is a market design in which one or more central agencies are responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. The central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.\n2. Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.\n3. Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Less effective in GEP and TEP models: Centralized procurement may not be as effective in the GEP and TEP models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination. In these cases, decentralized procurement may be more suitable.\n2. Potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency: Centralized procurement may introduce bureaucratic hurdles and potential inefficiencies, as decisions must be made by a central authority rather than individual market participants.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nAs a market design, centralized procurement is best suited for the CEP model, where joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is crucial for maintaining operational security in low-carbon power systems. However, for the GEP and TEP models, where decentralized coordination may be more effective, other market designs might be better suited. Policymakers and regulators should consider the specific characteristics of their power systems when selecting a market design for operational security.\n\nIV. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This approach aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Market-driven investment decisions: Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.\n\n2. Incentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.\n\n3. Better suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.\n\n2. Potential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.\n\n3. Complexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.\n\nD. Suitability for Different Models\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\nV. Decentralized Procurement via Network Access\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources. This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.\n\n2. Encourages Competition and Innovation: By allowing multiple connecting resources to participate in the procurement of system security services, Decentralized Procurement via Network Access fosters competition and innovation in the market. This can result in the development of more effective and cost-efficient solutions for maintaining system security.\n\n3. Better Suited for TEP and GEP Models: This market design may be more effective under the TEP and GEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. This enables connecting resources to address system security challenges in a more targeted manner.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of Centralized Coordination: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access may not be as effective under the CEP model, which requires joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The lack of centralized coordination in this market design may limit its ability to address system security challenges effectively in such scenarios.\n\n2. Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required. This market design is better suited for the TEP and GEP models, where it allows resources to make investments based on local conditions and constraints. In contrast, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the lack of centralized coordination. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nVII. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination is a hybrid market design that incorporates elements of both centralized and decentralized procurement models. It establishes local platforms to facilitate coordination and collective action among connecting resources. This design is particularly well-suited for handling complex common pool resources and promoting coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Supports complex common pool resources and coordinated renewable expansion: This design is capable of addressing the challenges associated with integrating low-carbon resources into power systems, particularly in situations where resources are shared by multiple users.\n\n2. Better suited for TEP and GEP models: Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination allows for local coordination and investment decisions, making it a suitable option for the Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) and Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) models.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Limited performance under the CEP model: The lack of centralized coordination in this design may hinder its effectiveness in the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nDecentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination is a promising option for the TEP and GEP models, where local coordination and investment decisions are essential. However, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the absence of centralized coordination.\n\nE. Case Studies and Applications\n\nThis section could include real-world examples and case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination in various contexts. These case studies could highlight how this market design has been successfully implemented in different power systems, its impact on operational security, and the lessons learned from these experiences.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\n\nA. Summary of market designs\n\nThe integration of low-carbon resources into power systems presents significant technical and economic challenges for maintaining power system security. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination, as a hybrid market design, offers a flexible and adaptable approach to address these challenges. By establishing local platforms for coordination and collective action, this design promotes efficient resource allocation and supports complex common pool resources and coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nB. Recommendations for policymakers and regulators\n\nPolicymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs for operational security in low-carbon power systems. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination is a promising option for various scenarios and contexts, making it a valuable tool for addressing the challenges associated with the integration of low-carbon resources. Policymakers and regulators should explore the potential applications of this market design and assess its suitability for their specific power systems, taking into account the unique requirements and characteristics of each context.\n\nVII.

This design is particularly effective for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\n2. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation: This market design relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities, promoting market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation.\n\n3. Decentralized Procurement via Network Access: A market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources, promoting market-driven investment decisions while addressing power system security challenges in low-carbon grids.\n\n4. Hybrid Centralized-Decentralized Procurement: This market design combines elements of centralized and decentralized procurement, allowing for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities while still providing flexibility for local decision-making.\n\n5. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination: A hybrid market design that combines decentralized decision-making with coordinated efforts through local platforms, allowing for local coordination and investment decisions while still promoting overall system security, making it suitable for managing complex common pool resources and promoting coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nEach market design has unique benefits and drawbacks, making them more or less suitable for different models and scenarios. The report examines these market designs in detail, assessing their suitability for various power system models, including Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP), Generation Expansion Problem (GEP), and Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) models. It also provides insights and recommendations for policymakers and regulators to consider when selecting a market design for operational security in low-carbon power systems.\n\nIII. Centralized Procurement\nA. Overview\n\nCentralized procurement is a market design in which one or more central agencies are responsible for procuring system security services to maintain grid stability. The central authority makes decisions regarding the procurement of these services, taking into account the needs of the entire power system. This design is particularly effective for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it allows for joint optimization of both generation and transmission capacities.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Effective for joint optimization: Centralized procurement is particularly effective for the CEP model, as it can optimize both generation and transmission capacities simultaneously, ensuring a more efficient and secure power system.\n2. Centralized coordination: The central authority ensures efficient decision-making and anticipation of future system needs, promoting a proactive approach to maintaining power system security.\n3. Reduced risk of market failures: Centralized procurement can help mitigate market failures that may arise in decentralized procurement models, such as underinvestment in essential services or coordination problems among market participants.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Less effective in GEP and TEP models: Centralized procurement may not be as effective in the GEP and TEP models, as these models do not fully capture the benefits of centralized coordination. In these cases, decentralized procurement may be more suitable.\n2. Potential for bureaucracy and inefficiency: Centralized procurement may introduce bureaucratic hurdles and potential inefficiencies, as decisions must be made by a central authority rather than individual market participants.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nAs a market design, centralized procurement is best suited for the CEP model, where joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is crucial for maintaining operational security in low-carbon power systems. However, for the GEP and TEP models, where decentralized coordination may be more effective, other market designs might be better suited. Policymakers and regulators should consider the specific characteristics of their power systems when selecting a market design for operational security.\n\nIV. Decentralized Procurement via Cost/Quantity Allocation\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is a market design that relies on market participants to procure system security services based on allocated costs or quantities. This approach aims to encourage market-driven contracting and investment decisions while maintaining efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Market-driven investment decisions: Decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation encourages market participants to make investment decisions based on their individual needs and assessments of system security services. This can lead to more efficient allocation of resources, as market participants have better knowledge of their own requirements.\n\n2. Incentives for innovation and competition: By allowing market participants to procure system security services independently, this design encourages competition and innovation in the market. This can lead to the development of new technologies and services that improve power system security.\n\n3. Better suited for Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) and Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) models: The decentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation design is well-suited for optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately, as it allows for investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of centralized coordination: This design lacks a centralized authority responsible for coordinating system security services, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions and potential inefficiencies.\n\n2. Potential for underinvestment in system security: Market participants may underinvest in system security services if they perceive the costs to be too high or if they expect other market participants to bear the responsibility. This could result in inadequate system security and increased risks.\n\n3. Complexity in cost/quantity allocation: Allocating costs or quantities accurately among market participants can be challenging, as it requires detailed information about the benefits and costs of system security services for each participant. This complexity can lead to disputes and delays in implementing the market design.\n\nD. Suitability for Different Models\n\nDecentralized procurement via cost/quantity allocation is better suited for GEP and TEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. However, it may not be ideal for the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model, as it lacks the centralized coordination needed for joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities.\n\nV. Decentralized Procurement via Network Access\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access is a market design that assigns responsibility for procuring system security services to individual connecting resources. This approach aims to promote market-driven investment decisions while addressing the challenges of power system security in low-carbon grids.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1. Local Coordination and Investment Decisions: One of the main advantages of Decentralized Procurement via Network Access is that it allows connecting resources to make investment decisions based on local conditions and constraints. This can lead to more efficient and tailored solutions for maintaining power system security.\n\n2. Encourages Competition and Innovation: By allowing multiple connecting resources to participate in the procurement of system security services, Decentralized Procurement via Network Access fosters competition and innovation in the market. This can result in the development of more effective and cost-efficient solutions for maintaining system security.\n\n3. Better Suited for TEP and GEP Models: This market design may be more effective under the TEP and GEP models, as it focuses on optimizing generation or transmission capacities separately. This enables connecting resources to address system security challenges in a more targeted manner.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Lack of Centralized Coordination: Decentralized Procurement via Network Access may not be as effective under the CEP model, which requires joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The lack of centralized coordination in this market design may limit its ability to address system security challenges effectively in such scenarios.\n\n2. Potential for Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without centralized coordination, there is a risk that individual connecting resources may make suboptimal investment decisions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and higher system costs.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nDecentralized Procurement via Network Access offers several benefits in terms of local coordination and investment decisions, competition, and innovation. However, it may not be the most effective option for all scenarios, particularly when joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities is required. This market design is better suited for the TEP and GEP models, where it allows resources to make investments based on local conditions and constraints. In contrast, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the lack of centralized coordination. Policymakers and regulators should carefully consider the trade-offs between different market designs to ensure efficient and secure operation of low-carbon electricity systems.\n\nVII. Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination\n\nA. Overview\n\nDecentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination is a hybrid market design that incorporates elements of both centralized and decentralized procurement models. It establishes local platforms to facilitate coordination and collective action among connecting resources. This design is particularly well-suited for handling complex common pool resources and promoting coordinated renewable expansion.\n\nB. Benefits\n\n1.

Better suited for TEP and GEP models: Decentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination allows for local coordination and investment decisions, making it a suitable option for the Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP) and Generation Expansion Problem (GEP) models.\n\nC. Drawbacks\n\n1. Limited performance under the CEP model: The lack of centralized coordination in this design may hinder its effectiveness in the Joint Generation and Transmission Expansion Problem (CEP) model.\n\nD. Suitability for different models\n\nDecentralized Procurement with Facilitated Coordination is a promising option for the TEP and GEP models, where local coordination and investment decisions are essential. However, its performance under the CEP model might be limited due to the absence of centralized coordination.\n\nE.

However, to make the answer comprehensible, let's break down your query into simpler terms and provide a high-level overview of the plurigrid protocol for distributed transactive energy coordination.\n\n1. Plurigrid Protocol: This refers to a protocol that enables the integration of multiple energy grids or networks to work together efficiently.\n\n2. Distributed Transactive Energy Coordination: This is the process by which energy resources, including generation, storage, and demand-side resources, are coordinated and managed through market-based transactions.\n\n3. Autopoietic Ergodicity: Autopoiesis refers to the self-organization and self-maintenance of a system. Ergodicity is a concept from statistical mechanics that assumes a system will explore all possible states over time. In this context, autopoietic ergodicity implies that the plurigrid system will dynamically adapt and reorganize itself for optimal performance.\n\n4. Stigmergic Feedback: Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination, where agents in a system interact by modifying their environment. In the context of plurigrid protocol, stigmergic feedback means that the actions of individual energy resources will affect the overall system's state, leading to emergent coordination and optimization.\n\nTo summarize, the plurigrid protocol for distributed transactive energy coordination aims to create an efficient, self-organizing, and adaptive network of multiple energy grids. This is achieved through autopoietic ergodicity, which allows the system to adapt and explore various states, and stigmergic feedback, where individual actions contribute to the overall coordination and optimization of the system."

Establish a decentralized network of energy nodes (e.g., smart grids, microgrids, energy storage systems, and prosumers) to facilitate communication and coordination among the energy resources.\n\n2. Implement an autopietic ergodicity mechanism in each energy node. This mechanism will allow nodes to self-organize, adapt, and optimize their energy production, storage, and consumption based on their internal states and the observed states of neighboring nodes.\n\n3. Utilize stigmergic feedback to communicate and propagate information on energy availability, demand, and prices across the network. This feedback will be stored in a shared environment (e.g., a distributed ledger) accessible by all nodes.\n\n4. Introduce a bidding mechanism whereby nodes can submit offers and requests for energy based on their current needs, available resources, and local energy prices. These bids will be stored in the shared environment and updated periodically.\n\n5. Employ a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., proof-of-stake or federated Byzantine agreement) to process and validate the bids, ensuring that energy transactions are agreed upon by a majority of participating nodes.\n\n6. Coordinate energy transfers between nodes based on the validated bids, prioritizing transactions that optimize overall grid efficiency, stability, and sustainability.\n\n7. Continuously monitor and adjust the network's autopietic ergodicity and stigmergic feedback mechanisms to maintain optimal energy coordination and resilience in the face of fluctuating energy demands, resource availability, and external factors (e.g., weather, grid failures, or cyberattacks).\n\nBy implementing this plurigrid protocol, distributed transactive energy coordination can be achieved through self-organizing, adaptive processes that promote efficiency, resilience, and sustainability across the network."

To design a plurigrid protocol for distributed transactive energy coordination by means of autopietic ergodicity with stigmergic feedback, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Define the plurigrid architecture: Establish a decentralized and distributed network of energy resources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, energy storage systems, and demand response assets. These resources should be capable of operating autonomously and communicating with each other.\n\n2. Implement autopietic ergodicity: Enable each energy resource to self-organize, adapt, and evolve based on its historical performance and the current state of the plurigrid. This will allow the resources to autonomously optimize their operations to achieve maximum efficiency and reliability.\n\n3. Design a stigmergic feedback mechanism: Develop a system for the energy resources to communicate their current state, performance, and requirements to the rest of the plurigrid. This can be achieved through the use of digital tokens, smart contracts, or other decentralized communication methods.\n\n4. Establish a transactive energy market: Create a marketplace where energy resources can participate in energy transactions, such as buying and selling excess energy, bidding on demand response events, or trading energy for other services. This market should be designed to incentivize efficient and sustainable resource management.\n\n5. Coordinate resources using the plurigrid protocol: Utilize the autopietic ergodicity and stigmergic feedback mechanisms to optimize the coordination of energy resources in the plurigrid. This can be achieved through distributed algorithms and consensus protocols that allow resources to autonomously make decisions based on the information they receive from the rest of the plurigrid.\n\n6. Monitor and evaluate performance: Continuously assess the performance of the plurigrid protocol in terms of efficiency, reliability, sustainability, and resilience. Use this information to iteratively update and improve the protocol over time.\n\nBy implementing these steps, a plurigrid protocol for distributed transactive energy coordination by means of autopietic ergodicity with stigmergic feedback can be achieved. This will enable the creation of a more efficient, sustainable, and resilient energy system that can adapt and evolve to meet the changing needs of the environment and society."

In this model, the fees generated from reworlding would help maintain and compensate the providers of distributed computing resources, allowing the Plurigrid system to continue offering value to NFT holders and other participants.\n\nOf course, this is just one possible solution, and the actual implementation might involve additional mechanisms or adjustments to ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of the network.\n\nNow it also needs to include thermodynamic and reachsbilitu considerations for updating the system if we are wrong\n\nPerfect!!

To explore this idea, let's first understand MEV and then draw parallels to the energy grid.\n\n1. Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) in Crypto: MEV refers to the maximum profit that can be extracted by a miner or validator by selectively including, excluding, or reordering transactions within a block. This practice often involves searching for arbitrage opportunities, liquidations, or other strategies to maximize the revenue generated by a miner or validator.\n\n2. Maximum Volatility Energy Extraction (MVEE) in the Energy Grid: In the context of the energy grid, MVEE can be understood as the process of maximizing profits or utility from the grid by taking advantage of fluctuations in energy prices or availability. This could involve:\n\n   a. Shifting energy consumption to periods of low demand or low prices.\n   b. Storing energy when it is abundant and cheap, and then releasing it back to the grid when demand is high or prices have increased.\n   c. Managing distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar panels or batteries, to optimize energy generation, storage, and consumption based on prevailing grid conditions.\n\n3. Challenges and Potential Solutions: Just like MEV can lead to issues in the blockchain ecosystem, MVEE in the energy grid may also introduce challenges. For instance, it might encourage gaming the system or create instability in the grid. Some potential solutions to address these challenges include:\n\n   a. Implementing market designs and pricing mechanisms that discourage gaming and promote stability.\n   b. Encouraging adoption of smart grid technologies and demand response programs that enable more efficient use of energy resources.\n   c. Developing regulatory frameworks that support innovation and ensure fairness in the energy market.\n\nIn conclusion, Maximum Volatility Energy Extraction (MVEE) is a concept that relates to optimizing profits or utility from the energy grid by leveraging fluctuations in energy prices or availability. Similar to MEV in the cryptocurrency space, MVEE presents both opportunities and challenges for the energy sector, which can be addressed through market designs, technology adoption, and regulatory frameworks."

MEV refers to the highest value that can be extracted by miners or validators in a blockchain ecosystem by reordering, delaying, or censoring transactions within a block. In the context of energy grids, MVEE would refer to extracting the most value from the grid by optimizing and exploiting fluctuations in energy prices and demand.\n\nTo explore MVEE, let's consider the following factors:\n\n1. Dynamic Pricing: Energy prices can fluctuate based on various factors such as supply and demand, time of day, and the availability of renewable energy sources. MVEE would involve identifying periods of high-price volatility and aligning energy consumption and production to take advantage of these fluctuations, thereby maximizing the value extracted from the grid.\n\n2. Demand Response: MVEE could be achieved by implementing demand response strategies, where consumers adjust their energy consumption in response to price signals or incentives. This can help decrease peak demand, increase grid stability, and enable consumers to benefit from lower energy prices during off-peak periods.\n\n3. Energy Storage: Energy storage systems, such as batteries, can play a crucial role in MVEE. By storing energy during periods of low demand and low prices, and releasing it during periods of high demand and high prices, energy storage systems can help maximize the value extracted from the grid.\n\n4. Smart Grid Technologies: Advanced metering, data analytics, and artificial intelligence can be employed to monitor and predict energy consumption patterns, grid conditions, and price fluctuations. These technologies can enable more sophisticated MVEE strategies that take into account real-time data and forecasted trends.\n\n5. Distributed Energy Resources (DERs): The integration of DERs, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles, can contribute to MVEE by allowing consumers to generate, store, and consume energy in a more flexible and decentralized manner. DERs can help reduce grid dependence, increase resiliency, and enable peer-to-peer energy trading, thereby maximizing the value extracted from the grid.\n\nIn conclusion, MVEE is an emerging concept that involves optimizing and exploiting the energy grid's volatility to maximize value extraction. This can be achieved through a combination of demand response, energy storage, smart grid technologies, and the integration of distributed energy resources."

        "text": "To discourage actions that destabilize the grid and prioritize personal gain over the system's stability, several measures can be implemented:\n\n1. Regulatory Oversight: Strengthening regulations and oversight can help ensure that market participants do not engage in activities that destabilize the grid. This can include strict penalties for those who manipulate the market for personal gain or neglect grid stability.\n\n2. Transparency and Monitoring: Implementing transparent and real-time monitoring systems can help identify and track any unusual activity or behavior that could negatively affect the grid. Early detection of such actions enables the responsible authorities to take corrective measures promptly.\n\n3. Incentivizing Stability: Introducing incentive mechanisms that reward participants for contributing to grid stability can encourage responsible behavior. For example, providing financial incentives for energy storage or demand response programs that help balance the grid can promote fault-tolerant operations.\n\n4. Market Design: Designing energy markets that inherently discourage destabilizing behavior can help mitigate potential issues. This can include mechanisms such as price caps, floors, or circuit breakers that limit extreme price fluctuations and reduce the incentive for market manipulation.\n\n5. Education and Awareness: Raising awareness among market participants about the potential consequences of destabilizing actions can help foster a sense of responsibility and discourage selfish behavior. Promoting a culture of cooperation and shared benefits can encourage participants to prioritize grid stability.\n\n6. Decentralized Control: Implementing decentralized control mechanisms, such as distributed energy resource management systems, can help reduce the risk of single points of failure and increase grid resiliency. A more robust grid is less likely to be affected by individual actions that seek to exploit its vulnerabilities.\n\n7. Collaborative Approach: Encouraging collaboration among market participants, grid operators, and regulators can help create an environment where all stakeholders work together to maintain grid stability. Sharing information, best practices, and innovative solutions can contribute to a more resilient and fault-tolerant system.\n\nIn summary, discouraging destabilizing actions in the energy grid requires a multi-faceted approach that combines regulatory oversight, market design, transparency, incentives, education, and collaboration. By fostering a responsible and cooperative environment, market participants can be encouraged to prioritize the stability and resilience of the grid over personal gains."

        "text": "Discouraging actions that destabilize the energy grid and extract value at the expense of overall system stability is crucial for maintaining a reliable and efficient power network. Here are some suggestions to deter such behavior:\n\n1. Regulatory Oversight: Establishing regulations and monitoring mechanisms to prevent market manipulation and penalize those who engage in destabilizing actions. Regulatory bodies should be empowered to enforce rules and impose fines or sanctions on those who attempt to exploit the grid for personal gain.\n\n2. Transparency: Implementing transparent pricing mechanisms and real-time data sharing can help stakeholders monitor market conditions and detect any unusual activity. Increased transparency can also discourage potential manipulators, as their actions would be more easily traceable.\n\n3. Market Design: Creating energy market structures that promote stability and discourage manipulation, such as capacity markets or ancillary service markets. These markets can provide incentives for participants to maintain grid stability and ensure the availability of essential resources during periods of high demand or unexpected events.\n\n4. Grid Resilience Measures: Investing in grid infrastructure and technologies that enhance the system's resilience, such as energy storage, microgrids, and advanced grid management systems. By making the grid more fault-tolerant and adaptable, it becomes more challenging for manipulators to create instability or extract value from it.\n\n5. Cybersecurity: Strengthening the cybersecurity of the energy grid and market systems can prevent unauthorized access and manipulation. Regular security audits, robust access controls, and advanced threat detection mechanisms can help protect the grid from both external and internal threats.\n\n6. Education and Awareness: Raising awareness among market participants and consumers about the potential risks and consequences of grid destabilization can foster a sense of collective responsibility. This can help create a culture that values and prioritizes grid stability over short-term gains.\n\n7. Collaborative Efforts: Encouraging collaboration among grid operators, utilities, regulators, and other stakeholders to share best practices, develop joint strategies, and coordinate efforts to deter destabilizing actions and maintain a reliable and secure energy system.\n\nIn summary, discouraging actions that destabilize the grid and create negative or zero-sum outcomes can be achieved through a combination of regulatory oversight, transparency, market design, grid resilience measures, cybersecurity, education and awareness, and collaborative efforts among key stakeholders."

These strategies aim to create an environment where cooperation is rewarded, and destabilizing actions are less attractive or even counterproductive.\n\n1. Reward-Based Incentive Structure: Design an incentive structure that rewards participants for maintaining grid stability and contributing to fault tolerance. This can include financial incentives for consistent energy supply, efficient energy consumption, or providing ancillary services that support grid stability. By rewarding cooperation, participants are more likely to act in the best interest of the grid.\n\n2. Penalty-Based Incentive Structure: Introduce penalties for participants who engage in destabilizing actions, such as withholding resources or trading in a way that harms grid stability. Penalties can be in the form of reduced payments, loss of market access, or reputational damage. This creates a negative feedback loop that discourages destabilizing behavior.\n\n3. Market Designs Encouraging Transparency: Implement market designs that promote transparency and information sharing among market participants. This can include open data platforms, real-time market information, or standardized reporting requirements. Transparency helps participants make informed decisions and reduces the likelihood of manipulative behavior.\n\n4. Two-Stage Market Design: Implement a two-stage market design, where the first stage involves capacity allocation to ensure adequate resources are available to maintain grid stability, and the second stage involves energy trading based on real-time supply and demand conditions. This design encourages participants to maintain adequate capacity, reducing the likelihood of destabilizing actions.\n\n5. Auction Mechanisms: Use auction mechanisms, such as sealed-bid auctions or combinatorial auctions, to allocate resources and services in the energy market. Auctions can help prevent collusion and promote fair competition, reducing the opportunities for market manipulation and destabilizing actions.\n\n6. Decentralized Market Design: Develop a decentralized market design that incorporates distributed energy resources and peer-to-peer energy trading. This can reduce participants' ability to manipulate the market or destabilize the grid, as control over resources is distributed among many actors.\n\n7. Robust Settlement Systems: Implement robust settlement systems that accurately account for the value of resources and services provided by market participants. This can include mechanisms that consider the externalities of destabilizing behavior, such as the costs of grid instability or the value of ancillary services.\n\n8. Adaptive Market Mechanisms: Incorporate adaptive market mechanisms that can respond to destabilizing actions or market conditions in real-time. This can include dynamic pricing models, demand response programs, or real-time adjustments to market rules and incentives. By being adaptive, the market can discourage destabilizing behavior and maintain grid stability.\n\nBy combining these market designs and incentive structures, it is possible to create a game theoretic environment that discourages destabilizing actions and promotes cooperation among market participants. This can be achieved without the need for legal intervention or modifications to grid hardware, relying instead on well-designed protocols and incentives that align the interests of all stakeholders."

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Market Mechanisms for Grid Stability: Introduce market mechanisms that directly reward participants for contributing to grid stability. For example, design an ancillary service market that compensates participants for providing voltage support, frequency regulation, or spinning reserves. By monetizing these stability services, participants are incentivized to act in the interest of grid stability.\n\n2. Penalties for Destabilizing Actions: Implement a system where market participants are penalized for actions that destabilize the grid. For example, participants could be charged higher fees or face reduced revenue share if their behavior is deemed harmful to grid stability. This creates a financial incentive for participants to avoid destabilizing actions.\n\n3. Market-based Capacity Mechanisms: Implement capacity markets or capacity obligations that require participants to commit to providing a certain level of reliable capacity during peak demand periods. By linking capacity payments to a participant's performance, these mechanisms encourage participants to maintain grid reliability and discourage actions that could lead to grid failures.\n\n4. Incentives for Demand Response: Encourage the participation of demand-side resources in the energy market through demand response programs. By providing financial incentives for consumers to reduce or shift their energy consumption during periods of high demand, demand response programs can help maintain grid stability and mitigate the impacts of potential destabilizing actions.\n\n5. Cooperation Incentives: Design market rules that reward participants for cooperating with each other in maintaining grid stability. For instance, create a bonus pool that distributes rewards to participants who collaborate in addressing grid stability issues or maintaining fault tolerance. This encourages a cooperative atmosphere and discourages destabilizing actions.\n\n6. Reputation-based System: Introduce a reputation-based system, where participants earn a reputation score based on their historical contribution to grid stability. A higher reputation score could lead to better market access, lower fees, or other benefits. This reputation system incentivizes participants to maintain good behavior and discourages destabilizing actions.\n\n7. Transparent Price Signals: Ensure that price signals in the energy market are transparent and accurately reflect the true costs of energy generation, transmission, and distribution, as well as the value of grid stability. This enables market participants to make informed decisions and discourages actions that could lead to grid destabilization.\n\nBy implementing these game-theoretic market designs and incentive structures, it is possible to discourage destabilizing actions and promote grid stability without relying on legal intervention or grid hardware modifications. These approaches create an environment where participants are financially and reputationally incentivized to act in the best interest of overall grid stability."

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Market Design - Capacity Market: Implement a capacity market where participants receive payments for committing to provide energy generation or demand-side resources during periods of high demand or system stress. This design encourages participants to maintain capacity and discourages them from withholding resources or engaging in destabilizing activities.\n\n2. Market Design - Ancillary Services Market: Create an ancillary services market that compensates participants for providing services that support grid stability, such as frequency regulation, voltage control, and spinning reserves. By rewarding these services, the market incentivizes participants to contribute to grid stability rather than destabilizing it.\n\n3. Incentive Structure - Performance-Based Rewards: Introduce performance-based rewards for market participants who consistently provide reliable energy resources or support grid stability. These rewards could be in the form of financial incentives, preferential dispatch, or reduced fees for market participation.\n\n4. Incentive Structure - Penalties for Destabilizing Actions: Implement penalties for market participants who engage in actions that contribute to grid destabilization, such as withholding resources or creating artificial volatility. These penalties could include financial charges or reduced market access privileges.\n\n5. Protocol Level - Transparent Market Information: Establish a transparent and accessible platform for sharing market information, including real-time data on energy generation, consumption, and grid stability. This transparency can help discourage manipulative behavior by making it easier for other market participants to monitor and counteract destabilizing activities.\n\n6. Protocol Level - Decentralized Coordination Mechanisms: Develop decentralized coordination mechanisms, such as blockchain-based platforms or distributed ledger technologies, to facilitate secure and transparent energy transactions among market participants. These technologies can promote cooperation and discourage destabilizing behavior by reducing the potential for centralized manipulation.\n\n7. Protocol Level - Automated Demand Response Programs: Implement automated demand response programs that allow consumers to adjust their energy consumption in response to real-time grid conditions and price signals. By enabling consumers to participate in grid stability, such programs can help discourage certain destabilizing actions by creating a more distributed and resilient demand side.\n\nThese market designs, incentive structures, and protocol level changes can create a game-theoretic environment that discourages destabilizing behavior and encourages cooperation among market participants. While these approaches do not rely on legal intervention or grid hardware modifications, it is essential to monitor their effectiveness and adjust them as needed to ensure a stable, reliable, and resilient energy system."

To provide a clear understanding of the proposed model, let's break down its key components:\n\n1. Microworld NFTs: Microworlds are areas defined with an agent, representing a specific part of the energy grid. These microworlds are tokenized as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and can be auctioned to interested parties, such as community choice aggregators, corporations, or energy companies.\n\n2. Open Plurigrid Hypergraph: Each participant in the network possesses their open Plurigrid, which engages with others hierarchically, resulting in a hypergraph that represents the relationships and interactions between different energy grids.\n\n3. Auctions and Inference: When a participant successfully bids on and acquires a microworld NFT, they gain access to a lifetime supply of inference predictions as long as they hold the NFT. These predictions can be performed at the edge or in cloud-based environments like Google Cloud, using distributed resources like vast.ai.\n\n4. Reworlding and Subscription Fees: As technology advances and new, more accurate microworlds are developed, participants can pay subscription fees in $GRID tokens to retrain their existing microworlds using the latest Plurigrid models. This ensures they always have access to the most up-to-date and accurate models for their energy management needs.\n\n5. Stock to GRID Token Conversion: Plurigrid stock can be converted into $GRID tokens. The stock value might fluctuate, but the conversion to $GRID tokens can provide a more stable means of participation in the Plurigrid ecosystem.\n\n6. Federated Learning and Rewards: Participants are rewarded in $GRID tokens based on their contributions to the collective understanding of local neighborhoods through federated learning. This incentivizes users to actively participate in the network and share valuable information that can improve overall energy management efficiency.\n\nThis tokenomics model creates a sustainable ecosystem that encourages users to engage with the Plurigrid network, continually improve their microworlds, and contribute to a more efficient and decentralized energy management system."

Federated learning rewards: Participants are rewarded in $GRID for their contributions to the understanding of their local neighborhood through federated learning. This incentivizes ongoing improvement and collaboration among the participants, ensuring the overall system continuously evolves and adapts.\n\nThis tokenomics model promotes a sustainable and evolving ecosystem, where participants are incentivized to contribute to the network's growth and maintain up-to-date microworlds.

The complexity of Microgrid Energy Scheduling (MES) is increasing with the integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Renewable Generations (RGs). Moreover, it is challenging to determine optimal scheduling strategies to guarantee the efficiency of the microgrid market and to balance all market participants’ benefits. In this paper, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach for residential MES is proposed to promote the autonomy and fairness of microgrid market operation. First, a multi-agent based residential microgrid model including Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and RGs is constructed and an auction-based microgrid market is built. Then, distinguish from Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SARL), MARL can achieve distributed autonomous learning for each agent and realize the equilibrium of all agents’ benefits, therefore, we formulate an equilibrium-based MARL framework according to each participant’ market orientation. Finally, to guarantee the fairness and privacy of the MARL process, we proposed an improved optimal Equilibrium Selection-MARL (ES-MARL) algorithm based on two mechanisms, private negotiation and maximum average reward. Simulation results demonstrate the overall performance and efficiency of proposed MARL are superior to that of SARL. Besides, it is verified that the improved ES-MARL can get higher average profit to balance all agents.\nKeywords: residential microgrid; energy scheduling; vehicle-to-grid; multi-agent reinforcement learning; game theory; equilibrium selection\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Motivation\nIn recent years, a microgrid-based family energy framework has increasingly attracted attention. This emerging residential energy system contains distributed Renewable Generations (RGs), household load appliances, and Energy Storage Units (ESUs). The application of residential microgrid reduces the user’s dependence on the main grid and improves the autonomy and flexibility of the family power system [1]. In the practical field, resident users, RGs and ESUs constitute a small and independent microgrid market [2,3]. It’s essential to formulate an intelligent and effective residential Microgrid Energy Scheduling (MES) mechanism for coordinating and balancing the benefits of all members, meanwhile, guaranteeing the members’ self-decision ability and information security.\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0001\u0004 \u0006\u0007\b\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\n Energies 2020, 13, 123; doi:10.3390/en13010123 www.mdpi.com/journal/energies\nEnergies 2020, 13, 123 2 of 26\nBesides, Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming more and more widespread in resident life due to its various advantages. EVs can effectively solve the pollution problem from traditional energy; in addition, the energy consumption cost of EVs is cheaper than gasoline vehicles [4,5]. Moreover, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) mode allows EVs to discharge energy to the power grid for participating in market scheduling and earning profit [6,7].\nConsidering the integration of EVs and RGs, residential MES becomes more complicated due to high uncertainties from EVs and RGs, such as RGs output and EVs’ usage attributes [8,9]. Therefore, some challenges exist in residential MES for previous studies shown in Section 1.2. First, it’s difficult to build a precise scheduling model that can attend to all the uncertain parameters. Second, the common centralized dispatch methods need a completely open market environment and could be problematic with a large system and multiple constraints. Third, most works are myopic solutions considering the current objectives, instead of a long-term optimization.\nAs a solution to confront these challenges, a model-free machine learning method, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has got a good effect on complicated decision-making problems. However, most RL methods adopt Single-Agent RL (SARL) to obtain the optimal policy, some defects exist in SARL whether the algorithm mode is centralized or decentralized. In centralized SARL, first, microgrid control center gathers all participants’ information and implements RL tasks centrally, each participant passively performs learning results from control center, rather than learning autonomously; second, participants need to upload necessary information to control center, thus part of private information may be at risk of leaking; third, the penetration of EVs and RGs will increase computational complexity of SARL, even lead to the curse of dimensionality. On the other hand, in decentralized SARL, each participant can learn and make decisions according to individual information and environment, but SARL is a kind of selfish learning to maximize self-reward, instead of considering overall profit and supply-demand balance of microgrid [10]; besides, the learning process of each participant is based on itself’s available information, they can’t obtain other agents’ some confidential information such as providers’ quotes and demand response behaviors of users, therefore, the agents’ learning processes are imprecise and there are no interactions among agents.\nTo address all the above issues, this paper presents a Multi-Agent RL (MARL) approach for residential MES. MARL is a distributed RL in multi-agent environment that can be seemed as a combine of RL and game theory [11]. Although the MARL framework is applicable to residential MES to construct a distributed microgrid RL architecture, some limitations restrict the application of existing MARL methods in the microgrid field. First, most MARL algorithms require agents to replicate other agents’ value functions and to calculate the equilibria for all joint-actions, which are computationally expensive. Then, if agents’ information is not be fully shared (incomplete information game), it’s difficult to obtain a definite equilibrium solution [12]. Finally, the solved equilibrium solutions may not be unique, how to select the optimal equilibrium to balance all agents’ rewards and to ensure the convergence of MARL are noteworthy [11,13]. In this paper, we present an Equilibrium Selection-based MARL (ES-MARL) method, an optimal Equilibrium Selection (ES) is adopted according to two mechanisms, that is private negotiation with each agent and maximum average benefit method.\n1.2. Related Works\nSeveral studies about residential MES considering EVs or RGs have been published using various approaches [14–20]. For example, a virtual power plant based on linear programming was used as a combination of wind generators and EVs to schedule the market in [14]. In [15], a dynamic programming-based economic dispatch for community microgrid is formulated. The authors in [16] proposed a hierarchical control method to achieve coordination scheduling integrating EVs and wind power. In [17], an EV coordination management algorithm was presented to minimize the load variance and to enhance the distribution network’s efficiency. A game theory-based retail microgrid market was built and a Nikaido-Isoda Relaxation approach was adopted to get the optimal solution [18]. A hierarchical control framework for microgrid energy management system with RGs and an ESU is\n\nEnergies 2020, 13, 123 3 of 26\nproposed [19]. Ref. [20] studies about a day-ahead scheduling of integrated home-type microgrid and adopts a mixed-integer linear programming algorithm to achieve optimal energy management.\nThese previous studies cannot take all challenges in MES into account. Therefore, RL-based method is adopted as solution. RL approach learns the optimal policies through trial-and-error mechanism, that does not depend on the prior knowledge of system model information, and RL has been widely used in energy scheduling of smart grid and EVs [12,21–23]. For instance, ref. [12] focused on the smart grid market based on double auction, an adaptive RL was used to find the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of energy trading game with incomplete information. The authors in [21] proposed an RL-based dynamic pricing and energy consumption scheduling algorithm for the microgrid system. In [22], a batch RL approach was adopted in residential demand response to make a day-ahead consumption plan. In [23], authors raised RL-based real-time power management to solve the power allocation for hybrid energy storage system in a plug-in hybrid EV.\nMoreover, in this paper, a MARL method is used for sequential decision making in multi-agent environment where traditional SARL is difficult to deal with. MARL has been adopted in some fields, such as vehicle routing problem [24] and thermostatically loads modeling [25]. The most universal MARL is equilibrium-based MARL, whose framework accords with Markov games and the evaluation of the learning process is based on all agents’ joint behaviors, the equilibrium concept from game theory is introduced to denote optimal joint action [26–30]. The earliest proposed equilibrium-based MARL was the Minimax-Q algorithm which considered two agents’ zero-sum game, two agents try to maximize and minimize one reward function [26]. Authors in [27] proposed Nash-Q algorithm for non-cooperative general-sum Markov games, and the NE solution was adopted to define value function. In [28], a friend-or-foe Q-learning algorithm was presented for obtaining different solutions based on agents’ relationships. In [29], Correlated-Q learning was proposed base on correlated equilibrium solution, which allows for the possibility of dependencies in the agents’ optimization. In [30], authors introduced a “Win or Learn Fast\" (WoLF) mechanism to form a variable learning rate based MARL method.\nThese papers have made contributions on the domain of microgrid energy scheduling or RL algorithm. Through the analysis and improvement of these studies, in this paper, a MARL approach is adopted for management and decision of distributed microgrid market.\n1.3. Contributions\nTo sum up, the principal contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.\n• A framework for residential MES with V2G system is built. All participants in the microgrid and the auction-based microgrid market mechanism are modeled.\n• MARL algorithm is introduced for the first time into a residential microgrid. The RL model (states, actions, and immediate reward) of each agent is formulated.\n• An improved ES-MARL is proposed, the Equilibrium Selection Agent (ESA) calculates the corresponding equilibrium solution by negotiating with agents and selects the optimal solution based on maximum average reward.\n1.4. Organization\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present the microgrid model and market mechanism. In Section 3, we summarize the MARL theory and the microgrid agents’ design of MARL. In Section 4, we propose the ES-based MARL method. Section 5 presents the simulation results and analyses. We conclude the paper in Section 6.\n\nEnergies 2020, 13, 123 4 of 26"

        "text": "6. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the energy scheduling of residential microgrid. The integrated residential microgrid system including RGs, power users and EVs V2G is constructed on the multi-agent structure and an auction-based microgrid market mechanism is built to adapt microgrid participants’ demands for distributed management and independent decision.\nIn order to generate the optimal market strategy for each participant and to guarantee the balance of all participants’ benefit and microgrid supply-demand, we introduce a model-free MARL approach for each agent. Through MARL, agents can consider both farsighted self-interest and the actions of other agents to make decision in a dynamic and stochastic market environment. Moreover, we present a novel ES-MARL algorithm to improve the privacy security, fairness, and efficiency of MARL. There are two cardinal mechanisms in ES-MARL, one is private negotiation between ESA and each agent, which can protect private information and reduce computational complexity; another is the maximum average reward method to select a global optimal equilibrium solution.\nThree parts of simulations have been carried out: (1) the comparison results between MARL and SARL verify that MARL is more appropriate for distributed microgrid scheduling to ensure agents individual benefits and overall operation objective; (2) the simulations with proposed ES-MARL and classic Nash-Q MARL are conducted, the results show that our proposed approach can achieve better performance of learning process and microgrid application; (3) a case study about 10 EVs charging/discharging scheduling demonstrates the effectiveness of secondary EVs scheduling system.\nIn conclusion, this work adopts an improved MARL approach for residential microgrid market scheduling. The learning results can enable agents to autonomously select strategy for promoting benefit; meanwhile, the microgrid system can coordinate all participant’s demands and achieve a high autonomy under the equilibrium-based learning process.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.F., J.W. and Y.H.; Methodology, X.F., Y.H. and Q.Z.; Software, X.F., Z.C. and G.S.; Validation, Y.H. and Q.Z.; Writing—Original Draft Preparation, X.F., G.S. and Z.C.

Through the learning process, agents can autonomously select strategies to promote their benefits while ensuring the microgrid system can coordinate all participant’s demands and achieve high autonomy under the equilibrium-based learning process. The simulation results demonstrated that the overall performance and efficiency of the proposed MARL are superior to that of Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SARL). Moreover, the improved ES-MARL can achieve a higher average profit to balance all agents."

        "text": "While the model presented above provides a comprehensive approach to modeling the Plurigrid system, there are a few concerns and limitations:\n\n1. Complexity: The system of differential equations is quite complex and may be challenging to solve analytically. Numerical methods might be required for finding solutions, and these methods can be sensitive to initial conditions and parameter estimation. Additionally, defining the functions G, I, R, E, and N could be difficult, as they may involve intricate relationships between the variables.\n\n2. Assumptions: The model assumes that all factors influencing energy generation, demand, storage, price, incentives, resilience, environmental impact, and network growth can be captured in the functions G, I, R, E, and N. In reality, there may be external factors or unknown variables that influence the system's behavior, making the model less accurate.\n\n3. Data availability: To calibrate and validate the model, historical data on all variables involved would be required. However, it may be challenging to obtain such data, particularly for variables like incentives, resilience, and network growth.\n\n4. Linearity: The model assumes that the relationships between variables are linear, which may not always be the case. In practice, the relationships could be nonlinear or involve feedback loops, and the model may not capture these complexities adequately.\n\n5. Time scale: The time scale on which the model operates is not specified. The dynamics of the Plurigrid system could change significantly over different time scales, and the model may not be applicable across all relevant time scales.\n\n6. Model validation: Given the complexity of the model and the potential for nonlinear relationships and feedback loops, validating the model's predictions against real-world data can be challenging. This could limit the model's applicability and reliability in predicting the behavior and sustainability of the Plurigrid system.\n\nTo address these limitations, it may be necessary to simplify the model, incorporate additional variables or relationships, or explore alternative modeling approaches, such as agent-based modeling or system dynamics. Additionally, obtaining high-quality data and refining the functions G, I, R, E, and N based on empirical evidence would be crucial for improving the model's accuracy and relevance."

This makes it difficult to understand the model as a whole and to interpret the equations. It is essential to clearly define all variables used in the model.\n\n2. Assumption of a continuous time model: The model uses differential equations, which assume that the variables change continuously over time. However, in real-world energy systems, some variables might change in a discrete manner, such as energy generation from solar panels that can only generate power during daylight hours. In such cases, a discrete-time model might be more appropriate.\n\n3. Complexity of the model: The model consists of a system of six differential equations, which could be challenging to solve and analyze. Depending on the specific functions `G`, `I`, `R`, `E`, and `N`, the system of equations might not have an analytical solution, requiring the use of numerical methods. Such methods can be computationally expensive and may not provide the same level of insight as an analytical solution.\n\n4. Uncertainty in the functions: The functions `G`, `I`, `R`, `E`, and `N` are not defined in the given model, and their specific forms will depend on the implementation details and mechanisms employed in the Plurigrid network. These functions might be difficult to define accurately, and any inaccuracies in their definitions could impact the validity of the model's predictions.\n\n5. Missing variables or interactions: The model might not capture all the relevant variables or interactions in the Plurigrid network. For example, it does not include factors such as policy changes, technology advancements, or the impact of external factors like natural disasters. If these factors significantly influence the system's behavior, their absence in the model might lead to inaccurate or incomplete predictions.\n\nTo improve the model, it is crucial to address these issues by clearly defining all variables, considering the appropriate time scale (continuous or discrete), simplifying the model if possible, and including any missing variables or interactions that could significantly impact the system's behavior. Additionally, it is essential to collect and analyze data to accurately define the functions `G`, `I`, `R`, `E`, and `N` and validate the model's predictions."

These functions may be oversimplified or may not capture all relevant factors affecting the variables.\n\n2. Complexity: The model is quite complex, with multiple variables and differential equations. This complexity may make it difficult to analyze and understand the behavior of the Plurigrid system. Additionally, finding accurate and precise values for the parameters in the functions may be challenging.\n\n3. Interdependence of variables: The model assumes that the variables are interdependent, which may lead to unintended feedback loops or other unexpected behavior. For example, an increase in energy generation may lead to a decrease in the environmental impact, but also to an increase in network growth, which could then lead to more energy generation and potentially negate the initial decrease in environmental impact.\n\n4. Lack of specific implementation details: The model is quite abstract and does not provide specific implementation details for the Plurigrid network. This could make it difficult to apply the model to a real-world scenario or to compare different Plurigrid implementations.\n\n5. Numerical methods and analytical techniques: Solving the system of differential equations may require sophisticated numerical methods or analytical techniques, which could be computationally expensive or require specialized knowledge.\n\n6. Uncertainty in parameter values: As mentioned earlier, finding accurate parameter values for the functions `G`, `I`, `R`, `E`, and `N` may be difficult. Additionally, these parameters may change over time, making it challenging to predict the long-term behavior of the Plurigrid network.\n\nIn summary, while this model attempts to capture the essential features of the Plurigrid network, its complexity, assumptions, and potential inaccuracies in parameter values may limit its usefulness for analyzing and understanding the behavior, sustainability, and efficiency of the Plurigrid system. Further refinement and simplification, as well as the incorporation of specific implementation details, may be necessary to make the model more practical and reliable."

For example, energy demand (d) can be modeled as a stochastic process:\n\n    d(t) = μ(t) + σ(t) * ε(t)\n    \n   Where μ(t) is the mean demand, σ(t) is the standard deviation, and ε(t) is a random variable sampled from a normal distribution.\n\n5. Game theory: Define the Plurigrid system as a game, with players being energy producers, consumers, and storage providers. Determine each player's strategy space and payoffs. For example, a Nash Equilibrium can be found by solving:\n\n    max_u U_i(u_i, u_{-i})\n    \n   Where U_i is the utility function of player i, u_i is player i's strategy, and u_{-i} represents the strategies of all other players.\n\n6. Optimization modeling: Formulate an optimization problem that maximizes system efficiency and sustainability while minimizing reworlding costs. For example:\n\n    Minimize: C_reworld + α * (C_gen + C_cons + C_store)\n    Subject to: g(t) >= d(t), s(t) >= 0, constraints related to reworlding costs\n\n   Where C_reworld is the amortized reworlding cost, and α is a weighting factor.\n\n7. Data-driven modeling: Use historical data to train machine learning or statistical models that predict variables in the Plurigrid system.

Please note that these examples are simplified illustrations and may need to be adapted and expanded for a complete analysis of the system.\n\n1. Agent-based modeling (ABM):\n\nConsider three types of agents: producers (P), consumers (C), and storage providers (S). Each agent i has an associated strategy (or action) a_i. For example, a producer's strategy could be the amount of energy to generate, while a consumer's strategy could be the amount of energy to consume.\n\nThe utility function U_i(a_i, a_{-i}) represents the benefit or payoff agent i receives from its strategy a_i, given the strategies of other agents a_{-i}. The goal of each agent is to maximize its utility.\n\nFor example, a simple utility function for a producer might be:\nU_P(a_P, a_C, a_S) = p(t) * a_P - c_P * a_P^2 - r_C * a_C,\nwhere p(t) is the market price of energy, c_P is the cost of production, and r_C is the cost of rewrolding associated with consumer demand.\n\n2. System dynamics modeling:\n\nA simple system dynamics model for the Plurigrid system could consist of three stocks: energy generation (G), energy consumption (C), and energy storage (S). Flows between these stocks represent the rate of energy generation, consumption, and storage.\n\nFor example, the rate of energy generation could be modeled as:\ndG/dt = k_G * (1 - G(t)/G_max),\nwhere k_G is the growth rate of energy generation and G_max is the maximum generation capacity.\n\n3. Discrete-event simulation:\n\nA discrete-event simulation of the Plurigrid system could involve simulating events such as energy generation (G), energy consumption (C), and energy storage (S) at discrete time steps.\n\nFor example, at each time step t, the energy generation event could be modeled as:\nG(t+1) = G(t) + g(t),\nwhere g(t) is the amount of energy generated at time t.\n\n4. Stochastic modeling:\n\nIn a stochastic model of the Plurigrid system, variables such as energy generation, consumption, and price could be represented as random processes.\n\nFor example, the energy generation at time t could be modeled as a random variable G(t) with a probability distribution function f_G(g), such as a Gaussian distribution.\n\n5. Game theory:\n\nIn a game-theoretic model of the Plurigrid system, the interaction between energy producers and consumers could be represented as a non-cooperative game. For example, a simple two-player game between a producer (P) and a consumer (C) with strategies a_P and a_C, respectively, could have the following payoff matrix:\n\n```\n            Consumer\n            C_low  C_high\nProducer P_low  (u_P1, u_C1) (u_P2, u_C2)\n         P_high (u_P3, u_C3) (u_P4, u_C4)\n```\n\n6.

Each agent i has a utility function U_i, which depends on energy generation g_i, demand d_i, storage capacity s_i, and cost of reworlding c_i. The goal of each agent is to maximize their utility.\n\nU_i = f(g_i, d_i, s_i, c_i)\n\nThe model represents each agent's behavior, interactions, and decision-making processes based on a set of rules. These rules can be derived from domain knowledge or data-driven techniques. The simulation is run for a specific time horizon, and the overall system behavior emerges from the individual actions of the agents.\n\nAgent-based modeling can capture the emergent properties, complex dynamics, and spatial aspects of the Plurigrid system, providing insights into how the system evolves and adapts over time.\n\n2. System dynamics modeling:\n\nSystem dynamics modeling focuses on understanding the feedback loops, delays, and nonlinear relationships between variables in the Plurigrid system. Stocks, flows, and feedback loops are used to represent the structure of the system, and the model is simulated over time to analyze its long-term behavior and stability.\n\nKey stocks in the Plurigrid system can include energy generation (G), demand (D), storage (S), and reworlding cost (C). Flows represent the change in these stocks over time, and feedback loops capture the interactions between variables.\n\nThe model is constructed using system dynamics software or programming tools, and sensitivity analysis can be performed to identify critical variables and parameters that influence the system's behavior.\n\n3. Discrete-event simulation:\n\nDiscrete-event simulation models the operation of the Plurigrid system as a sequence of events, such as energy generation, consumption, and storage. Each event changes the state of the system, and the simulation is run over a specific time horizon.\n\nThe model can be used to analyze the performance and efficiency of the system under different scenarios and conditions, such as variations in energy generation, demand, storage capacity, and reworlding costs.

Optimization modeling:\n\nOptimization models are used to identify the most efficient and sustainable configuration of the Plurigrid system, such as the optimal mix of energy sources, storage capacity, and network topology. The objective function represents the total cost of the system, including the amortized reworlding cost, and is subject to constraints on energy generation, demand, and storage.\n\nLinear programming, nonlinear programming, or mixed-integer programming techniques can be used to solve the optimization problem and find the optimal solution for the system.

Here's an outline of the mathematical elements for the hybrid model:\n\n1. Data-driven modeling: Use regression models or machine learning algorithms to identify relationships between variables. For example, a linear regression model for energy generation (g) as a function of time (t) and other factors (X) can be represented as:\n\ng(t) = β_0 + β_1 * X_1(t) + β_2 * X_2(t) + ... + β_n * X_n(t) + ε(t)\n\nwhere β_i are the coefficients to be estimated, and ε(t) is the error term.\n\n2. Agent-based modeling: Define utility functions for each agent i (energy producers, consumers, storage providers) based on energy generation (g_i), demand (d_i), storage (s_i), reworlding costs (c_i), and other relevant factors (X_i):\n\nU_i = f(g_i, d_i, s_i, c_i, X_i)\n\nSimulate the behaviors and interactions of agents based on their utility functions and the relationships identified in the data-driven modeling stage.\n\n3. Discrete-event simulation and stochastic modeling: Model the energy generation, demand, storage, and reworlding costs as stochastic processes:\n\ng(t) = G(ω_g(t))\nd(t) = D(ω_d(t))\ns(t) = S(ω_s(t))\nc(t) = C(ω_c(t))\n\nwhere ω represents random variables and G, D, S, and C are functions describing the stochastic processes.\n\n4. System dynamics modeling: Define stocks and flows for energy generation (G), demand (D), storage (S), and reworlding costs (C):\n\ndG/dt = g(t) - g_consumed(t)\ndD/dt = d(t) - d_met(t)\ndS/dt = s_in(t) - s_out(t)\ndC/dt = c_in(t) - c_amortized(t)\n\nIncorporate feedback loops and nonlinear relationships to capture the system's dynamics.\n\n5. Game theory: Define payoff functions for each player i (energy producers, consumers, regulators) considering their utilities (U_i) and amortized reworlding costs (c_amortized_i):\n\nPayoff_i = U_i - c_amortized_i\n\nAnalyze the game's equilibrium and identify optimal strategies for different stakeholders.\n\n6. Optimization modeling: Define an optimization problem to minimize the total cost of the Plurigrid system (C_total), subject to constraints on energy generation, demand, and storage:\n\nMinimize: C_total = C_energy + C_storage + C_reworlding_amortized\nSubject to: g(t) ≥ d(t), s(t) ≥ 0, and other system constraints\n\nSolve the optimization problem to identify the optimal configuration of the system.\n\nThis outline provides a general framework for the hybrid model, incorporating elements from different modeling approaches. The specific mathematical representations and functions will depend on the details of the Plurigrid system and the availability of data and information."

The goal of each agent is to maximize their utility.\n\nU_i = f(g_i, d_i, s_i, ...)\n\nDefine the strategy space Σ_i for each agent i, which represents the set of possible strategies available to the agent.\n\nThe game G is defined as G = (A, Σ, U), where A is the set of agents, Σ is the strategy space for each agent, and U is the utility function for each agent.\n\n2. Stochastic modeling:\n\nIncorporate random variables into the model to account for uncertainties in energy demand, generation, and storage. For example, g_i(t), d_i(t), and s_i(t) can be modeled as stochastic processes with probability distributions estimated from historical data or expert knowledge.\n\n3. System dynamics analysis:\n\nDevelop a system dynamics model representing the stocks, flows, and feedback loops of the Plurigrid system, including the agent-based game theoretic model:\n\n- dG/dt = g(t) - g_consumed(t)\n- dD/dt = d(t) - d_met(t)\n- dS/dt = s_in(t) - s_out(t)\n\nInclude feedback loops to capture interactions between energy generation, demand, storage, and agent strategies.\n\n4. Optimization modeling:\n\nFormulate an optimization problem to minimize the total cost of the Plurigrid system, considering the agent-based game theoretic model and the system dynamics analysis:\n\nMinimize: C_total = C_energy + C_storage + C_other_costs\nSubject to: g(t) ≥ d(t), s(t) ≥ 0, and other system constraints\n\n5. Data-driven modeling:\n\nTrain data-driven models (e.g., machine learning or statistical models) on historical data to analyze patterns and relationships between variables in the Plurigrid system. Use these models to refine the agent-based game theoretic model, the system dynamics model, and the optimization model:\n\n- Linear regression model: Y = β_0 + β_1X_1 + β_2X_2 + ... + ε\n- Time series model: Y_t = f(Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, ...)\n- Neural network model: Y = f(W, X, b)\n\nBy combining these modeling approaches, the proposed mathematical model will be able to analyze the Plurigrid system's behavior, performance, and efficiency across different scales, time frames, and levels of uncertainty in real-world data. This comprehensive and robust representation will inform the development of effective policies and strategies for the operation and management of the Plurigrid system."

She is interested in working on the project with our treat. She has also been independently working on her project, AOL which has many parallels to Plurigrid. Her background is a hackerish type with experience in hardware design, prototyping and software development.\n\nEllie Day is interested in the plurigrid project and has had lots of cool conversations with the team but she feels the communication has been lacking and she wasn’t give the resources she needs to succeed. Her goals have been unclear and she has felt separate or out of the loop.\n \n\nEllie is interested in Plurigrid (a autopoietic distributed transactive energy coordination protocol) because of its parallels with aol ( a global distributed computer that can run in the browser and across devices enabling universal access to AI and giving people control over various algorithmic models made of them). She thinks it could be useful in allowing people access to basic infrastructure and seizing the means of electricity production. She did not mention many drawbacks but obviously it is important that these technologies are deployed in such a way as to benefit the flourishing of humanity.\n\nAOL is implemented primarily digitally. It runs in browsers using iframes and web workers. It has the possibility to run on really any device that can run a browser and it could run in the background without the users interaction. Allowing for unused compute on many devices to be leveraged. Users could be rewarded economically for the value generated similar to how in browser crypto miners function. Companies could also be insentavised (Netflix was given as an example of someone who might build this into there app on smart tvs) by being rewarded with some percentage of the economic value generated. AOL isn’t particularly focused on hardware but similarly to Plurigrid it is written primarily in wasm meaning it could run on any device supporting a compatible run time. Plurigrid is similar in many ways but must also address hardware scaling and regulator challenges. Plurigrid not only needs to create a distributed compute network but also interface with various hardware devices and manage transactions across multiple chains.\n\nSome future plans discussed including working together on developing the crdt synchronization needed for Plurigrid or developing hardware together. Ellie’s previous efforts hacking smart inverters were discussed where she lamented the difficulty of putting new CPU’s in them and recommended instead making dumb inverters smart. She also discussed the need for standardization of IOT hardware interfaces complaining the companies like ecoflow had nice ways of interconnecting hardware but it was proprietary. She likened what’s needed to legos or something magnetic where modules could snap together. She recommended the open source matter protocol as a potential way to interoperate with iot devices. I suggested the idea of implementing popular embedded controllers as soft cores in an an fpga and then adding additional plurigrid nexus soft cores to extended functionality. The idea here would be that hardware manufacturers could add there devices with relatively little redesign only needing to replace there devices ec and update the footprint on the board to the new fpga footprint making the integration of plurigrid relativly low.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Ellie shared that her time with Plurigrid has been interesting but that communication has been lacking. Previously she lost a million dollars and her dog died. Recently she has been recovering from some health issues. These factors combined means she had been led performant in recent years than she might be typically however she feels optimistic that she is on an upward trajectory.

        "text": "To formulate a high-level theoretic model that can be applied to other systems and suggest how Plurigrid might shift the economics and behaviors of individuals, we can consider the following key aspects:\n\n1. Incentive structure: Plurigrid may introduce new incentives for energy producers, consumers, and storage providers. These incentives could encourage more efficient and sustainable energy generation, consumption, and storage practices.\n\n2. Market dynamics: Plurigrid may affect the market dynamics of energy supply and demand, leading to changes in energy prices, market competition, and the adoption of new technologies.\n\n3. Information sharing: Plurigrid may enable better information sharing and coordination among energy producers, consumers, and storage providers, leading to more efficient decision-making and resource allocation.\n\n4. Environmental impact: Plurigrid may contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts associated with energy generation and consumption, by promoting the use of renewable energy sources and efficient energy storage systems.\n\n5. Resilience and reliability: Plurigrid may enhance the resilience and reliability of the energy system by facilitating the integration of diverse energy sources, storage solutions, and demand management strategies.\n\nBased on these key aspects, we can develop a high-level theoretic model that captures the potential effects of Plurigrid on the economics and behaviors of individuals in other systems:\n\n1. Define key variables and parameters:\n\n   - `I_i(t)`: Incentives for agent i at time t\n   - `P(t)`: Market price of energy at time t\n   - `M(t)`: Market competition at time t\n   - `E(t)`: Environmental impact at time t\n   - `R(t)`: Resilience and reliability of the system at time t\n\n2. Agent utility functions:\n\n   `U_i(t) = f(g_i(t), d_i(t), s_i(t), c_i(t), I_i(t), P(t), M(t), E(t), R(t))`\n\n3. System dynamics:\n\n   `dI(t)/dt = I(g_i(t), d_i(t), s_i(t), c_i(t))`\n   `dP(t)/dt = P(G(t), D(t), S(t), M(t))`\n   `dM(t)/dt = M(G(t), D(t), S(t))`\n   `dE(t)/dt = E(g_i(t), d_i(t), s_i(t))`\n   `dR(t)/dt = R(G(t), D(t), S(t))`\n\n4. Game theoretic model:\n\n   - Define strategy spaces and payoffs for agents, considering the updated utility functions and system dynamics\n   - Analyze Nash equilibria and their implications for the economics and behaviors of individuals in the system\n\nBy incorporating these high-level aspects into the theoretic model, we can analyze how the introduction of Plurigrid might shift the economics and behaviors of individuals in other systems. This model can be used as a starting point for exploring the potential impacts of Plurigrid on energy generation, consumption, storage, market dynamics, environmental outcomes, and system resilience. As more data becomes available, the model can be refined and calibrated to better capture the specific characteristics of the Plurigrid system and its effects on individual behavior."

This generalized model can be adapted to specific contexts and systems once data becomes available.\n\n1. Define agent-specific variables:\n\n   - `g_i(t)` = energy generation of agent i at time t\n   - `d_i(t)` = energy demand of agent i at time t\n   - `s_i(t)` = energy storage of agent i at time t\n   - `c_i(t)` = reworlding cost of agent i at time t\n   - `U_i(t)` = utility of agent i at time t\n   - `N` = number of agents\n\n2.

These functions can be adapted to different systems and contexts, considering factors such as energy prices, incentives, and regulations.\n\n3. Interaction mechanisms:\n\n   Define the mechanisms through which agents interact with each other and the system, such as energy trading, storage sharing, and participation in incentive programs. These mechanisms can be modeled using game theory, agent-based modeling, or other approaches that capture the strategic behavior of agents.\n\n4. System dynamics:\n\n   Develop a high-level system dynamics model that captures the aggregate behavior of the system, including energy generation, demand, storage, and reworlding costs. This model can be adapted to different systems and contexts by incorporating specific stocks, flows, and feedback loops relevant to the target system.\n\n5. Impact of Plurigrid:\n\n   Analyze the impact of Plurigrid on the economics and behaviors of individuals by comparing the outcomes of the model with and without Plurigrid. This can be done by simulating the model under different scenarios, such as varying levels of Plurigrid adoption, changes in energy prices, or modifications to incentive programs.\n\n6. Adaptation and learning:\n\n   Incorporate adaptation and learning mechanisms into the model to represent how agents and the system evolve over time in response to changes in the environment, policies, or technologies. This can be done using reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, or other approaches that capture the dynamics of learning and adaptation.\n\nBy developing this high-level theoretical model, we can gain insights into how Plurigrid might shift the economics and behaviors of individuals in different systems. The model can be refined and calibrated once data becomes available, allowing for more accurate predictions and analysis of the Plurigrid system's impact."

This high-level model can be adapted to different contexts and provide insights into the potential impact of Plurigrid on various systems.\n\n1. Decentralized energy generation and consumption:\n   - Plurigrid promotes decentralized energy generation (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines) and local consumption, reducing the reliance on centralized power plants and long-distance transmission.\n   - This shift can lead to increased energy efficiency, reduced transmission losses, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n2. Dynamic pricing and demand response:\n   - Plurigrid enables dynamic pricing of energy based on real-time supply and demand, encouraging consumers to adjust their energy consumption patterns to minimize costs.\n   - This can result in more efficient use of energy resources, reduced peak demand, and lower overall energy costs for consumers.\n\n3. Energy storage and grid resilience:\n   - Plurigrid facilitates the integration of energy storage systems (e.g., batteries, pumped hydro) into the grid, improving the ability to store excess energy during periods of low demand and release it during periods of high demand.\n   - This can enhance grid resilience, reduce the need for peaking power plants, and support the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources.\n\n4. Incentives and market mechanisms:\n   - Plurigrid can implement various incentives and market mechanisms (e.g., feed-in tariffs, net metering, capacity markets) to encourage the adoption of renewable energy generation, energy storage, and demand response technologies.\n   - These incentives can help accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and resilient energy system.\n\n5. Network effects and innovation:\n   - As more participants join the Plurigrid network, the value of the system increases due to network effects, creating a positive feedback loop that encourages further adoption and innovation.\n   - This can lead to the development of new technologies, business models, and services in the energy sector, driving economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe high-level theoretic model can be represented as a set of relationships between the key variables and mechanisms in the Plurigrid system:\n\n1. Decentralized energy generation and consumption: g(t) ↔ d(t)\n2. Dynamic pricing and demand response: p(t) ↔ d(t)\n3. Energy storage and grid resilience: s(t) ↔ R(t)\n4. Incentives and market mechanisms: I(t) ↔ (g(t), s(t), d(t))\n5. Network effects and innovation: N(t) ↔ (G(t), D(t), S(t), R(t), I(t))\n\nThis model can be adapted to different systems by specifying the functional forms of these relationships and incorporating relevant contextual factors. By analyzing the interactions and feedback loops between the variables, the model can provide insights into how Plurigrid might shift the economics and behaviors of individuals in various systems, promoting a more sustainable, efficient, and resilient energy future."

Check the available branches in your repository by running the following command:\n```\ngit branch\n```\nThis will display a list of all the branches in your repository, with an asterisk (*) next to the currently active branch.\n\n4. To switch to a different branch, use the `git checkout` command followed by the name of the branch you want to switch to:\n```\ngit checkout branch_name\n```\nReplace \"branch_name\" with the actual name of the branch you want to switch to.\n\nFor example, if you want to switch to a branch named \"feature-x\", you would run:\n```\ngit checkout feature-x\n```\n\nIf the branch does not exist locally and you want to create and switch to it, you can use the `-b` flag:\n```\ngit checkout -b new_branch_name\n```\n\nOnce you've switched branches, you can continue working on your project within the new branch."

An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning to the user.\n\nWhen used correctly agents can be extremely powerful. The purpose of this notebook is to show you how to easily use agents through the simplest, highest level API.\n\nIn order to load agents, you should understand the following concepts:\n\nTool: A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL, other chains. The interface for a tool is currently a function that is expected to have a string as an input, with a string as an output.\n\nLLM: The language model powering the agent.\n\nAgent: The agent to use. This should be a string that references a support agent class. Because this notebook focuses on the simplest, highest level API, this only covers using the standard supported agents. If you want to implement a custom agent, see the documentation for custom agents (coming soon).\n\nAgents: For a list of supported agents and their specifications, see here.\n\nTools: For a list of predefined tools and their specifications, see here.\n\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nFirst, let’s load the language model we’re going to use to control the agent.\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\nNext, let’s load some tools to use. Note that the llm-math tool uses an LLM, so we need to pass that in.\n\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\nFinally, let’s initialize an agent with the tools, the language model, and the type of agent we want to use.\n\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)\nNow let’s test it out!\n\nagent.run(\"Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend?

        "text": "I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the 'AgentType' import is incorrect. Since the LangChain documentation is not up-to-date, I recommend referring to the source code or installed package to find the correct import. You can try the following steps to find the correct import:\n\n1. Navigate to the installed package directory:\n\n```bash\ncd /Users/aja/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/agent-Xu0lj1NS-py3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/langchain/agents\n```\n\n2. List the available files:\n\n```bash\nls\n```\n\n3. Look for a file that might contain the agent types, such as `agent_types.py` or similar.\n\n4. Open the file and look for the correct import statement.\n\nAlternatively, you can try importing the agent directly and see if it works:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\n# Replace 'YourAgentClassName' with the correct agent class name\nagent_class_name = 'YourAgentClassName'\n\ndef main():\n    # Load the language model\n    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\n\n    # Load the tools\n    tools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\n\n    # Initialize the agent\n    agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=agent_class_name, verbose=True)\n\n    # Run the agent with a query\n    result = agent.run(\"Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?\")\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nReplace `'YourAgentClassName'` with the correct agent class name found in the source code."

An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning a response to the user. Here are the agents available in LangChain.\n\nzero-shot-react-description\nThis agent uses the ReAct framework to determine which tool to use based solely on the tool’s description. Any number of tools can be provided. This agent requires that a description is provided for each tool.\n\nreact-docstore\nThis agent uses the ReAct framework to interact with a docstore. Two tools must be provided: a Search tool and a Lookup tool (they must be named exactly as so). The Search tool should search for a document, while the Lookup tool should lookup a term in the most recently found document. This agent is equivalent to the original ReAct paper, specifically the Wikipedia example.\n\nself-ask-with-search\nThis agent utilizes a single tool that should be named Intermediate Answer. This tool should be able to lookup factual answers to questions. This agent is equivalent to the original self ask with search paper, where a Google search API was provided as the tool.\n\nconversational-react-description\nThis agent is designed to be used in conversational settings. The prompt is designed to make the agent helpful and conversational. It uses the ReAct framework to decide which tool to use, and uses memory to remember the previous conversation interactions.\n\nPrevious\n\nAgents\n\nNext\n\nCustom Agent\n\nzero-shot-react-description\nreact-docstore\nself-ask-with-search\nBy Harrison Chase\n\n© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.\nLast updated on May 11, 2023.\n🦜\n🔗\n\n⌘ + K"

Conditional imports: The code checks if it's running in a type-checking environment (e.g., with mypy) or not. If not, it imports the `Browser` classes from the Playwright library.\n\n3. `PlayWrightBrowserToolkit` class definition: This class inherits from `BaseToolkit` and is designed to work with Playwright's browser automation capabilities.\n\n4. Class attributes: The class has two optional attributes, `sync_browser` and `async_browser`, which store instances of synchronous and asynchronous Playwright browsers, respectively.\n\n5. `Config` class: This nested class configures the behavior of the Pydantic model, forbidding extra attributes and allowing arbitrary types.\n\n6. `validate_imports_and_browser_provided` method: This method is a root validator that checks if either `async_browser` or `sync_browser` is provided and raises a `ValueError` if neither is specified.\n\n7. `get_tools` method: This method returns a list of `BaseTool` instances, which are the tools available in the toolkit. These tools include `ClickTool`, `NavigateTool`, `ExtractTextTool`, and others.\n\n8. `from_browser` class method: This method is a factory method that creates an instance of `PlayWrightBrowserToolkit` with the provided `sync_browser` or `async_browser` instances.\n\nThe code is part of the LangChain library, which is a framework for creating and working with agents that can perform various tasks, such as web scraping, data extraction, and automation.

The Plurigrid protocol is a decentralized approach to manage energy resources in a smart grid, enabling efficient energy management and coordination among different grid components. In this paper, we present CityLearn, a simulation framework for the Plurigrid protocol, which allows researchers and practitioners to evaluate and optimize the performance of the protocol in various scenarios. The framework is designed to be flexible, extensible, and easy to use, and it includes a set of tools for visualizing and analyzing the results. We also provide a set of case studies to demonstrate the capabilities of CityLearn and the potential benefits of the Plurigrid protocol.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe Plurigrid protocol is a decentralized approach to manage energy resources in a smart grid, enabling efficient energy management and coordination among different grid components. In this paper, we present CityLearn, a simulation framework for the Plurigrid protocol, which allows researchers and practitioners to evaluate and optimize the performance of the protocol in various scenarios.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[Plurigrid Protocol] --> B[CityLearn Simulation Framework]\nB --> C[Case Studies]\nB --> D[Performance Evaluation]\nB --> E[Optimization]\n```\n\n## 2. CityLearn Simulation Framework\n\nCityLearn is a simulation framework designed to model the behavior of the Plurigrid protocol in a smart grid environment.

It emphasizes the causal links, big or small, that are essential to determine how any part of a story works to communicate a storyline or construct meaning.\n\nThe approach discusses how the relationships between the events and actions of characters/stories not only derive from causality but also demonstrate a clear connection to constructing compelling narratives. Researchers in causal narratology analyze and dissect different narrative elements, such as time structure (chronology, flashbacks, or flashforwards), complexities (e.g., multiple storylines, counterfactuals), focalization of information from specific points of view, and possibilities (different paths the story could take) while keeping causality at the core of their investigation. Causal narratology provides valuable insights on how narrative coherence is explicitly and implicitly reliant upon causal relationships. The usefulness of these insights reveal broad implications, transcending vast scales, from individual interpretation to cross-cultural exchanges in grasping the meanings of common and disjointed narratives."

This approach is particularly concerned with examining how events, actions, and choices are linked, as well as attempting to determine their causal relationships and how they contribute to the development of the narrative. Causal narratology addresses questions such as: How are events ordered, and who or what is responsible for them? How do particular events or choices lead to specific outcomes or changes in characters, their relationships, or entire storyworlds?\n\nWhile studying causal narratology, scholars take into account various elements of a narrative like character motivations, influences of the setting or context, and connotations or meanings drawn from the language or symbols in the story. Analysis can be based on varying theories (linearity, parallelism, conflict, constraint, enabling forces, etc.) to understand underlying causes, impacts, and plausible explanations for events in the narrative.\n\nBy examining causal factors and relationships, researchers can gain deeper insights into the dynamics of a story, assess its quality, and can compare or analyze multiple stories and their systems of causation. The results eventually bring new perspectives and meanings to literature and storytelling as an art, pedagogy, or cultural phenomenon."

It is primarily concerned with the way in which events and actions portrayed in a narrative contribute to the overall progression and coherence of the story. By examining the causal relationships between events, causal narratology seeks to identify how these relationships shape the narrative and give meaning to a reader or audience.\n\nThe central idea of causal narratology is that narratives are intrinsically linked to cause and effect. While there may be myriad ways to structure a narrative, a coherent narrative can be broken down into a series of logical and interconnected causal events necessary for its integrity.\n\nKey aspects of causal narratology include:\n\n1. Plot: Plot is the sequence of cause-effect events that drives the progression of the narrative. Unlike an unrelated sequence of events, a plot has a distinguishable causal structure that shapes its progression.\n\n2. Actants: Actants generally refer to characters, objects, or phenomena within a story that hold key functions and play crucial roles in driving its progression. Causal narratology focuses on how actants influence, impact, or drive causal events within the text.\n\n3. Motivation: Central to a causally constructed narrative are clear and logical motivations for any change-driving events or character actions. Understanding what motivates each action and event helps clarify underlying causal connections and enhance the narrative's consistency.\n\n4. Temporal Organization: Causal narratology depicts time by breaking down narrative into distinct moments that represent a temporal progression of sequentially ordered causal events.\n\nCausal narratology can enhance the reader's comprehension and deepen their appreciation for the story being told. By understanding the sequential and causally-related nature of narratives, this lens of analysis can provide insights and clarity when examining literary or oral narratives alike."

With the construction of new potentialities within a timeline, denizens exchange causal relatedness for hyper-causal fantasies swirling in with an added dimension of self-manipulation—perhaps seeing thought fallibility or hyper-intel was too critical thereof—and having a sense of floating bliss, for all is becoming one with every narrative milieu that can be fan__''•''__ol_gistically conjured.\n\nIn the meta-mesa hyper-hyper monodial-monadic perspective, the causal narratology embraces the ever-spiraling intricacies of narrative constructorial agency, embodying a topographical continuum of potential causality without discrimination.

Check them out and feel free to add your own via PRs.\n\n⚖️ Rationale\nComputational notebooks allow arguing from evidence by mixing prose with executable code. For a good overview of problems users encounter in traditional notebooks like Jupyter, see I don't like notebooks and What’s Wrong with Computational Notebooks? Pain Points, Needs, and Design Opportunities.\n\nSpecifically Clerk wants to address the following problems:\n\nLess helpful than my editor\nNotebook code being hard to reuse\nReproduction problems coming from out-of-order execution\nProblems with archival and putting notebooks in source control\nClerk is a notebook library for Clojure that aims to address these problems by doing less, namely:\n\nno editing environment, folks can keep using the editors they know and love\nno new format: Clerk notebooks are either regular Clojure namespaces (interspersed with markdown comments) or regular markdown files (interspersed with Clojure code fences). This also means Clerk notebooks are meant to be stored in source control.\nno out-of-order execution: Clerk notebooks always evaluate from top to bottom. Clerk builds a dependency graph of Clojure vars and only recomputes the needed changes to keep the feedback loop fast.\nno external process: Clerk runs inside your Clojure process, giving Clerk access to all code on the classpath.\n🚦 Status\nALPHA, expect breaking changes.\n\n👩‍🎨 Using Clerk\nTo use Clerk in your project, add the following dependency to your deps.edn:\n\n{:deps {io.github.nextjournal/clerk {:mvn/version \"0.13.842\"}}}\nRequire and start Clerk as part of your system start, e.g. in user.clj:\n\n(require '[nextjournal.clerk :as clerk])\n\n;; start Clerk's built-in webserver on the default port 7777, opening the browser when done\n(clerk/serve! {:browse? true})\n\n;; either call `clerk/show!` explicitly\n(clerk/show! \"notebooks/rule_30.clj\")\n\n;; or let Clerk watch the given `:paths` for changes\n(clerk/serve! {:watch-paths [\"notebooks\" \"src\"]})\n\n;; start with watcher and show filter function to enable notebook pinning\n(clerk/serve! {:watch-paths [\"notebooks\" \"src\"] :show-filter-fn #(clojure.string/starts-with? % \"notebooks\")})\n\n;; Build a html file from the given notebook notebooks.\n;; See the docstring for more options.\n(clerk/build! {:paths [\"notebooks/rule_30.clj\"]})\nYou can then access Clerk at http://localhost:7777.\n\nSee the /notebooks folder in the Clerk repository for a number of sample notebooks.\n\nEditor Workflow\nFor even better flow states, we recommend you bind clerk/show! to a shortcut in your favorite editor:\n\nEmacs\nIn Emacs, add the following to your config:\n\n(defun clerk-show ()\n  (interactive)\n  (when-let\n      ((filename\n        (buffer-file-name)))\n    (save-buffer)\n    (cider-interactive-eval\n     (concat \"(nextjournal.clerk/show! \\\"\" filename \"\\\")\"))))\n\n(define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd \"<M-return>\") 'clerk-show)\nIntelliJ/Cursive\nIn IntelliJ/Cursive, you can set up REPL commands via:\n\ngoing to Tools→REPL→Add New REPL Command, then\nadd the following command: (show! \"~file-path\");\nmake sure the command is executed in the nextjournal.clerk namespace;\nlastly assign a shortcut of your choice via Settings→Keymap\nNeovim + Conjure\nWith neovim + conjure one can use the following vimscript function to save the file and show it with Clerk:\n\nfunction! ClerkShow()\n  exe \"w\"\n  exe \"ConjureEval (nextjournal.clerk/show! \\\"\" . expand(\"%:p\") . \"\\\")\"\nendfunction\n\nnmap <silent> <localleader>cs :execute ClerkShow()<CR>\n🪚 Developing Clerk\nMake sure you have Babashka installed, and run:\n\nbb dev :browse\\? true\nThe will start everything needed to develop Clerk and open your default browser. You can connect your favorite editor to it using nREPL.\n\nAny trailing arguments to bb dev will be forwarded to clojure -X and clerk/serve!. So if you prefer to not open your browser, leave out the :browse\\? true arguments.\n\n🐞 Known Issues\nSee notebooks/onwards.md.\n\nCiting Clerk\nIf you are a researcher and use Clerk in your work, we encourage you to cite our work.

Please provide feedback on Ask Clojure or Clojurians slack in #clj-on-windows.\n\nPrerequisite installation details\nbrew (Mac or Linux)\nbrew is a package manager for Mac OS X or Linux. To install brew:\n\nGo to https://brew.sh/ and follow the installation instructions for your OS\n\nJava\nClojure requires Java. Clojure officially supports Java LTS releases (currently Java 8, 11, and 17), but also tries to ensure interim versions work as well. You can use any Java distribution, whether it’s a commercial release from Oracle or an open source version based on OpenJDK (like Temurin). The Clojure tools require only that the java command is on the PATH or that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set.\n\nIf you don’t already hava Java installed, we recommend installing Adoptium Temurin 17.\n\nTo use the Adoptium Temurin installers:\n\nGo to https://adoptium.net/\n\nDownload and run the installer appropriate to your platform\n\nEnsure java is on the system PATH\n\nOn Mac, you can also install Temurin using brew:\n\nbrew tap homebrew/cask-versions - add the cask-versions tap to Homebrew\n\nbrew install --cask temurin17 - install Temurin 17 (formerly AdoptOpenJDK)\n\nCheck your Java version by running java --version. If that’s not Temurin 17, then you may then need to add java to your PATH:\n\necho 'export PATH=\"/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.zshrc\nMore information\nFor other versions of the Clojure command-line tools, see the changelog for version history and the Clojure tap for info on installing older versions or newer prereleases instead.\n\nOriginal author: Alex Miller\n\nCOMMUNITY\nResources\nContributing\nCompanies\nSite\nLEGAL\nLicense\nPrivacy Policy\nDOCUMENTATION\nOverview\nReference\nAPI\nGuides\nLibraries & Tools\nUPDATES\nNews\nEvents\nETC\nClojureTV\nBooks\nSwag\nCODE\nReleases\nSource\nClojureScript\nClojureCLR\n \nCopyright 2008-2022 Rich Hickey | Privacy Policy\nLogo & site design by Tom HickeyPublished 2023-05-12\nUpdate this page"

        "text": "Transcript:\nCan you repeat what you said? Yes. Prior to starting any other system related objectives and carrying them out, either by automated processes or yourself, the data structure that will be used for that is to be bootstrapped correctly and aligned with the structure of the Pluri\ngrid, yes, day to day. The structure includes simple health checks. It's probably what you do, not do. You know, you reset it to zero, except this one task. You need to create while something else is doing research for you. Amplify your agency by launching and at all times asking yourself, is what I'm doing now also being augmented? Something else that you will need to be doing next is also being augmented by an entity to which I delegated the agency of doing this. Temporarily, you get it back when you synthesize the results. The first thing you do, you draw from Topos, pull the filaments of your work, and Topos Prep is kind of not there. So you first need to create this data structure, install your understanding and reconcile it with the task list that you have, launch the agent of the Plurigrid. And this data structure doesn't just include the task list, it includes all of the metadata in context of my own. Context as well, precisely. That's how our task can be better. The tasker, I'm hypergraphic of our work. You can imagine the fullest extent of it, you can imagine the necessary and variant things that we still have. The variant things need to be local first, swarmable, stigmegic, which means just enough data trace to bootstrap itself if somebody tries to process this data or understand what happened next. It's stigmegic in a very special way. If anyone tries to run this next-foken prediction model, or predict next-foken in an unsupervised way, it's going to be a bad task. What we're going to do that, we'll be also completing this in a way that is self-sustaining and self-similar and resilient. It's going to have to start paying attention to total energy functions. Total energy function of the actual tree graph, whatever, the metaphor of GMI, gradient-based methods, or any kind of value iteration learning with backward information for any of such things will benefit from next-task prediction. To predict the next task, we have to have information on previous tasks, which means the first step of that involves curating the context of what we have and finding out how to represent it. What it looks like to have an index of data, what it looks like to have exported all the transcripts or logs. It means taking your own shared GPT data and somehow all the different systems that we have in front of you, creating an evaluation data set, but what you need to do first is pick one simple thing, a green thing. One simple data structure? Sorry? One simple data structure, you mean? It means something abstract. You can apply it today, it speaks what it means, but these invariants need to be there because of how we work. You have to imagine going through the most fully realized structure of how the day would go, and if it's not there, what's the absolute coherent necessary structure to put in place for coherence? For me right now, personally, I have to ask myself, it means resuming from a failed session, not from the beginning, but having some sort of optimization objective. This would have been optimizing perhaps prematurely, but if you think about the cost and time, time is something I would like to optimize slightly, even if it's not there. It means finding something that's at least equivalent to what is there now, which is a list of tasks and methods, a category. It means also understanding the context of what has happened and trying to store the context as it comes at you fast, while you are meticulously, unabashedly, with complete determination and understanding that that is the right way to go about it, go about the simple task and store the least amount of content. How can you store it? You can see it, and then it's stored. You see it on my screen when I show it to you in a get-it-down section. I mean, even if you're here, if you ask me a question, I'm going to insist on get-it-down, because then when I show you something, it's not just going to your eyes, it goes to the mind's index, to my machine and your machine, even as a screen share. You say, what did he say? Transcripts, right? So with new context, just feel good about it, that you're not missing something important, but you shouldn't be doing something, you shouldn't be doing anything but this one simple thing. Forget who you exist. Create an embedding of my top class. Concretely, I said concretely. WebDot can see collaboration and environment. WebDot can see wireless. You're recording this. No, these are just options. I'm not giving you assignments. I'm asking you to think for yourself. You don't ask me questions. You have to understand why you're doing it. I wasn't sure if the solution will suggest itself. I was actually making a specification. There is a very precise specification I can make, but would I make it? Probably not, because it's one of the things to do. I've made it many times. If you go back, if you actually analyze the actual process... I was trying to clarify whether or not you were giving suggestions or defining a specification. These are suggestions that are good suggestions. Yeah, of course. I'm not actually giving bad suggestions. These are suggestions that I think will end up being critical suggestions. That's only one portion, one view of the stack. Now the view of the stack is the UX from the perspective of the user. The pluralistic information layout possibilities into operable, most platform access. It's the multiplayer. You're asking to repeat myself. I hate people these days who ask me to repeat myself. I've told you everything you need to know. I was wanting it in recording. Over months. Yes, I know, but I wanted it in recording. You have recordings enough, but if you go back and actually properly index information in retrieval systems that you built will be correct. Everything I've said is already there. It's ontology. Just ontology is sufficient. Like I said before, just having the 1000 language is sufficient. Okay. Yes, send me that. Okay.\n\nSummary:\nPrior to beginning any system-related tasks or processes, it is important to ensure the data structure is bootstrapped and aligned with the structure of the Plurigrid. This structure should include simple health checks, resetting to zero, and creating while something else is doing research. To amplify your agency, you must launch and ask yourself whether the task is also being augmented. Additionally, a delegated entity should be performing this task, and you should synthesize the results once it is complete. The first task is to draw from Topos and pull the filaments of your work, then install your understanding and reconcile with the task list. The data structure should include metadata and context, helping you to better understand the task. Lastly, it should be self-sustaining, self-similar, and resilient, paying attention to total energy functions."

Plurigrid is a protocol that expands electricity resource capacity and scientific planning for electrical resources feasible in the real world. The protocol uses incentive engineering infrastructure and incentive models for grid participants using the Augmented Bonding Curve + Cyberphysical System constraints from operating DER. Plurigrid also has a Hybrid IBC for private instances of the protocol to operate infrastructure for its faithful implementation, as well as the relayer pattern for connecting to the public IBC. The protocol allows constituencies served by the electric grid under protocol to express their intent and ensure the valid decision making process, prevent fraud, and ensure overall incentive alignment using the Commons Stack and other instruments. Additionally, there is an integration between CosmWasm contracts and the mobile UI that each Microgrid will be able to customize to their own liking and ship resulting apps for multiple platforms, to be used by the participants in the microgrid. Plurigrid also has open hardware and infrastructure in operating Hybrid IBC, as well as distributed consumer devices like chargers, which can be used as templates. There are also research initiatives that allow for new modes of coordination on a macro and micro level, e.g. Open Games Engine and Multi-Party Computation.
