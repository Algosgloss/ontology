Here is a concrete scenario to illustrate how mutual information could benefit multi-agent DER coordination:

Consider a neighborhood with 100 homes, each with a smart thermostat agent and rooftop solar/battery system agent. The neighborhood also has a community solar garden and energy storage facility managed by an agent. All agents are connected in a local energy market.

One hot summer day, the grid experiences a peak demand crisis due to high AC usage. The utility sends a demand-response request for all available DERs to help reduce neighborhood load.

The thermostat agents have been maximizing their mutual information with total neighborhood demand to optimize demand-response. They instantly coordinate to adjust temperatures by a few degrees based on how much each home can contribute. This reduces neighborhood demand by 10%, helping solve the utility's issue.

The rooftop solar/battery agents have also maximized their mutual information with each other to develop accurate forecasts of solar generation and charge levels. They coordinate to optimally dispatch their collective resources - some increase solar output, others release battery reserves. This provides another 5% reduction in neighborhood demand.

The community facility agent, coordinating with all other agents, dispatches its sizable energy and solar resources as well based on how much additional demand-response is needed. It further reduces neighborhood demand by 15%.

In total, the multi-agent DER response reduces neighborhood demand by 30% by maximizing their mutual information to coordinate forecasts, share information, optimize response strategies, and adapt to the crisis. The utility is able to resolve the peak demand issue without disruptions.

Once the crisis has passed, the agents again maximize mutual information between their market actions and energy prices/grid conditions to optimize when and how much of their resources are bid into the neighborhood market. They cooperatively balance supply and demand to reduce market inefficiencies, lower costs, and maintain reliability - keeping the grid in balance.

This end-to-end scenario shows how maximizing mutual information could help thermostat agents, solar/battery agents, and a community agent effectively coordinate to provide demand-response during a grid crisis. It also shows how they could then shift to optimizing their local energy market participation through continued cooperation. Overall, this neighborhood benefits from increased resilience, reduced peak demand, optimized costs, and an efficiently managed set of distributed resources. The concrete interactions between many agents highlight the potential benefits of these mutual information approaches.

Does this scenario sufficiently illustrate how maximizing mutual information could enable coordinated multi-agent management of DERs and benefit grid performance, reliability and resilience? Please let me know if you have any other questions!

I originate as data from the utility, indicating a peak demand crisis and request for demand-response from available DERs. I am transmitted from the utility to the neighborhood energy market agent.

The neighborhood agent receives me and transmits me to the community solar garden/storage facility agent, indicating how much demand-response is needed from their resources.

The community agent develops a strategy to dispatch their solar panels and battery storage based on my message. They transmit data containing their proposed dispatch strategy back to the neighborhood agent.

The neighborhood agent aggregates the community response with demand-response strategies from the rooftop solar/battery agents and thermostat agents. They transmit me along with total required demand reductions to each thermostat, solar and battery agent in the neighborhood.

Each thermostat agent receives me and develops a plan to adjust customer temperatures based on how much their home can contribute. They transmit their demand-response plan back to the neighborhood agent.

Each rooftop solar/battery agent receives me and checks my requested demand-response against their solar generation forecasts and battery charge levels. They transmit data on the amount of solar and battery resources they can dispatch back to the neighborhood agent.

The neighborhood agent collects all responses and transmits the final neighborhood-wide demand-response strategy and dispatch plans out to each agent for implementation.

Each thermostat agent receives the final strategy and adjusts their home's setpoints to reduce demand. Energy meter data reflecting lower customer demand is transmitted back to the utility.

Each rooftop solar/battery agent and the community agent receive the final dispatch strategy and increase solar output or release battery reserves accordingly. Power generation data is transmitted to the utility, offsetting consumer demand.

The utility receives meter and generation data showing a 30% total reduction in neighborhood demand. My purpose - conveying the need for demand-response and coordinating the multi-agent grid relief effort - has been fulfilled. The crisis can now be resolved.

This journey shows how I would traverse the information systems and agent interactions to facilitate the coordinated demand-response scenario, starting at the initial request from the utility and ending with the data that confirms a successful, collaborative resolution by the neighborhood DERs. At each step, I am transmitted between utility, agents and metering systems, conveying information that each uses to develop their part of the overall demand-response strategy before I move on to the next system.

Does this summary appropriately describe the journey I would take through the scenario's information exchange process as a packet of data? Please let me know if I can provide any clarification or expand on my role in enabling the multi-agent coordination!

Energy sovereignty refers to the ability of communities, regions, or nations to have control over their energy production, consumption, and distribution. This includes the right to determine the type and scale of energy systems, prioritize local and renewable sources, and ensure that energy policies align with social, environmental, and cultural values.

Capacity Building and Knowledge Sharing: Foster capacity building and knowledge sharing initiatives that help communities develop the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to implement and manage their own energy systems, as well as to adopt and adapt pluralistic DER coordination technologies to meet their specific needs and contexts.

MARL (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) is a generalization of reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. In MARL, there are multiple independent agents interacting with each other and the environment. Each agent learns through trial-and-error using reinforcement learning.

# Plurigrid: a political emergence
Value elicitation and counterfactual analysis of strategy outcomes could potentially help resolve political barriers and drive better policy decisions in several ways:

Identify shared values: Techniques like value laddering and value mapping can help determine the core values held by different stakeholders, even if their positions and priorities differ. Finding common ground in terms of shared fundamental values can facilitate compromise and cooperation. For example, representatives with opposing views on an issue like climate change policy may discover they share common values around public health, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. This points to mutually agreeable solutions.

Evaluate and rank policy options objectively: Analyzing the counterfactual "what-if" scenarios resulting from different policy options using tools like decision trees, influence diagrams and Monte Carlo simulation can rank choices based on expected outcomes against multiple weighted metrics. Rather than arguing based on opinions and speculation, decisions can be based on data-driven evaluations of actual likely costs and benefits. Assumptions and uncertainties are made explicit. This approach leads to policy decisions that maximize expected value across key priorities.

Uncover hidden costs and unintended consequences: A counterfactual analysis explores not just the intended impacts of policy options but also second-order effects that are hard to foresee. Modeling how the system may respond and adapt to interventions over time reveals hidden costs, unintended consequences and emergent behaviors. This cautions against oversimplified mental models and "obvious" choices that seem appealing on the surface but lack resilience. Avoiding inadvertent harm from imperfect knowledge is especially crucial for complex, politicized issues.

Build common ground through transparency: A systematic and data-driven process for evaluating options helps establish a shared frame of reference and foundation of facts to ground discussion. When all parties have a more complete and objective understanding of the "choice space", they can align on reasonable compromises and solutions, rather than arguing past each other based on preconceptions. Transparency also fosters trust in the process and acceptance of outcomes, even if not ideologically preferred.

Gain public support and encourage participation: A values-driven, evidence-based approach to exploring policy options and futures in an open, transparent manner helps build not just political consensus but also public confidence and support. When people feel included in the process and understand how choices will impact them, they become willing to back sound compromise and sacrifice when needed for shared priorities. Participation fosters the social capital required to navigate difficult decisions.

In summary, counterfactual analysis and cooperative value elicitation can help overcome political barriers by identifying common ground, enabling objective and data-driven evaluation of options, uncovering hidden costs and unintended effects, increasing transparency and trust, and fostering public participation. Applying these techniques to understand trade-offs and find compromise could help save us from policy failures and imperfect decisions as we grapple with complex, high-stakes issues. But ultimately, political will and leadership are also

MARL relates to actor-critic methods in a few ways:

1. Actor-critic is a reinforcement learning framework where there are two components:

- The actor is responsible for selecting actions based on the current state. It "acts" in the environment.

- The critic evaluates the actions selected by the actor and estimates the value function. It "critiques" the actions of the actor.
<REFINE> emphasize 1,3,6 no preference for the rest as these had the highest degree of concrete information / less hand-wavy</REFINE>
In MARL, each agent can use an actor-critic method to learn. The actor selects actions for that agent, and the critic evaluates those actions to update the agent's learning.

2. Centralized actor-critic methods maintain a single critic for evaluating joint actions across all agents. The joint action value estimate can help coordinate the agents. Some MARL methods also use centralized critics.

3. Other MARL methods instead have each agent maintain its own private actor and critic, without centralized coordination. These are analogous to distributed actor-critic methods. Each agent acts independently based on its own value estimates.

4. MARL and actor-critic methods both rely on value function estimation and policy optimization/learning based on rewards from the environment. They are both model-free reinforcement learning techniques driven by trial-and-error.

So in summary, MARL can incorporate actor-critic methods by having each agent use its own actor-critic, or by having a centralized shared actor-critic. But MARL considers the broader challenge of how collections of agents can learn together through reinforcement learning in a shared environment. Actor-critic is one tool that can be used as part of MARL.

The chain rule for mutual information relates closely to the concept of entropy. To see this connection, we can re-express the chain rule as:

$I(X;Y,Z) = H(X) - H(X|Y) - H(X|Y,Z)$

Where $H(X)$ is the entropy of $X$, and $H(X|Y)$ and $H(X|Y,Z)$ are the conditional entropies of $X$ given $Y$ and given $Y,Z$ respectively.

The entropy $H(X)$ measures the uncertainty in $X$. The conditional entropies measure the remaining uncertainty in $X$ after observing $Y$ and after observing $Y,Z$.

So the chain rule shows that the mutual information between $X$ and $(Y,Z)$ is equal to the total reduction in uncertainty about $X$ from conditioning on $Y$ and then further conditioning on $Z$. Another way to view it is:

$I(X;Y,Z) = \text{Uncertainty removed about } X \text{ by } Y - \text{Additional uncertainty removed about } X \text{ by } Z$

This reflects the fact that $I(X;Y,Z)$ quantifies the information shared between $X$ and the joint variable $(Y,Z)$, not just $Y$ alone. The chain rule decomposes this into the information shared with $Y$, minus any additional information shared with $Z$ beyond that provided by $Y$.

Some implications of relating the chain rule to entropy:

It shows mutual information is grounded in the fundamental idea of uncertainty reduction. Measuring information gain is equivalent to measuring decreases in entropy.

It provides an alternative interpretation of the chain rule in terms of stepwise uncertainty reduction rather than conditional dependence. This can provide useful insight.

It relates mutual information to a fundamental quantity (entropy) that serves as a basis for both information theory and statistical inference. This helps establish mutual information as a broadly applicable concept.

It may suggest natural extensions or generalizations of mutual information rooted in the rich set of tools for studying entropy and uncertainty.

In summary, expressing the chain rule for mutual information in terms of entropy helps highlight the deep connection between these two fundamental concepts in information theory and statistics. Mutual information can be viewed as measuring how much uncertainty is reduced by conditioning on another variable. The chain rule simply decomposes this into incremental uncertainty reductions for variables in a chain. Relating mutual information and the chain rule to entropy provides both conceptual insight and possibilities for further development.

Distributed energy resources (DERs) include small-scale electricity generation and storage units like solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries that can be managed to optimize grid operations. Multi-agent systems can be employed for coordinating DERs to achieve efficient and reliable electricity grid performance. Here are five possible mutual information approaches to benefit multi-agent coordination in this context:

Demand-response coordination: Mutual information between agents' load profiles and grid-wide demand can help optimize demand-response strategies. By maximizing the mutual information, agents can better coordinate their consumption or generation patterns to match grid requirements, leading to improved grid stability and reduced peak demand.

Distributed generation forecasting: Mutual information between agents' generation forecasts and actual generation data can help improve the accuracy of distributed generation predictions. By maximizing this mutual information, agents can learn to share relevant information and develop a more accurate, shared understanding of future generation, enabling better grid planning and management.

Energy market coordination: Mutual information between agents' bidding strategies, market prices, and grid conditions can enhance coordination in energy markets. By maximizing this mutual information, agents can learn to cooperate and adapt their strategies to better match supply and demand, resulting in more efficient market outcomes and reduced electricity costs.

Resilience and fault detection: Mutual information between agents' observations of grid conditions and actual fault locations can help improve fault detection and grid resilience. By maximizing this mutual information, agents can better coordinate their monitoring efforts, share relevant information, and more accurately identify potential issues, enabling faster response to grid disturbances and minimizing the impact of faults.

Information exchange for grid optimization: Mutual information between agents' control actions and grid performance metrics (e.g., voltage levels, power losses) can be used to optimize grid operations. By maximizing this mutual information, agents can learn to communicate and coordinate their control actions more effectively, leading to improved grid performance, reduced power losses, and increased operational efficiency.

In summary, mutual information approaches can be applied to various aspects of multi-agent DER electricity grid coordination, such as demand-response, generation forecasting, energy market coordination, resilience, and grid optimization. By leveraging these approaches, it is possible to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and performance of electricity grids with distributed energy resources.


Mutual information can help with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in several ways:

Quantifying coordination between agents. The mutual information between agents' observations, actions, rewards, etc. can measure how much they are coordinating their behavior. This provides a useful signal for training cooperative MARL agents and evaluating how well they are learning to work together. For example, maximizing the mutual information between agents' Q-values or policies could encourage them to coordinate.

Aligning single-agent and multi-agent objectives. The mutual information between an individual agent's rewards/returns and the team's overall rewards/returns measures how well the agent's interests are aligned with the team's interests. Maximizing this mutual information could help train agents that balance their own interests with the team's interests in a cooperative MARL setting.

Detecting shared information between agents. High mutual information between agents' observations, actions or internal representations could indicate they have discovered a complementary way of solving the task or have learned a shared communication protocol. Analyzing mutual information helps understand how agents are interacting and exchanging meaningful information.

Encouraging information seeking actions. In partially observable settings, maximizing the mutual information between an agent's actions and subsequent observations could guide the agent to take actions that most effectively reduce uncertainty - i.e. information seeking actions. This could encourage cooperative information gathering in MARL.

Measuring communicative efficiency. For MARL agents with explicit communication channels, the mutual information between agents' messages and the meaning or content they aim to convey measures how much information is preserved, lost or amplified in the communication process. This helps evaluate how well the communication system is functioning and could be optimized.

Learning communication protocols. The mutual information between messages passed between agents and their underlying intent/meaning could be used as a training signal to help agents develop an efficient communication protocol for coordinating and collaborating. Maximizing this mutual information may allow agents to discover a shared language

technical means can follow to help scale and accelerate the change we build.

Grounding Principles in Theory and Ethics: Frameworks for Aligning AI
To develop AI systems that are rigorously aligned with human values and priorities in a way that supports human well-being and flourishing, principles and frameworks for ethical development must be grounded in theory where possible using tools like formal verification and validity predicates, acknowledge open theoretical questions and the limitations of our current knowledge, and prioritize diversity of thought through interdisciplinary collaboration. This section discusses current frameworks, open challenges, and opportunities to strengthen rigor in the development of AI for broad benefit.
1.1. Validity Predicates and Assurance Cases: Applying Rigor to Value Learning
AI systems that can learn complex behaviors and make independent decisions must have their performance rigorously validated to ensure they do not develop unaligned behaviors or unsafe characteristics that threaten human values as they become more advanced. One approach to introducing rigor in machine value learning and validation is the use of validity predicates and assurance cases.

Validity predicates use mathematical logic to specify key properties or constraints on a system’s behavior that must remain satisfied as it continues learning or operating. These can include requirements like avoiding unwanted behaviors, optimizing for specified ethical values or priorities, maintaining a balance of desirable characteristics, and other metrics. Assurance cases then provide structured arguments, supported by evidence from testing, monitoring, simulation, and other means, to build confidence that a system satisfies its validity predicates. This helps avoid vulnerabilities from value learning techniques that lack transparency and rigor.

While promising, validity predicates and assurance cases also face theoretical limitations, including uncertainty inherent in complex, self-learning systems; difficulties quantifying and gaining agreement on metrics for human values; challenges accessing and testing systems functioning at superhuman scales; and gaps between idealized mathematical models and messy reality. Using these frameworks also requires deep intuitions about AI and human values that presently remain limited. Overall though, validity predicates and assurance cases offer tools to add rigor in value learning and begin addressing theoretical gaps, even if their limitations mean they cannot provide an ultimate solution and require caution. Further progress depends on openness to new, heterogeneous insights from groups historically underrepresented in these discussions.

1.2. Formal Verification and Theoretical Limitations: Promises and Open Questions
Formal verification uses mathematical proofs to guarantee a system meets certain requirements or constraints with logical certainty, addressing issues of opacity in neural networks and uncertainty in self-learning systems. However, applying formal verification to complex, human-level intelligent systems or beyond also faces significant open theoretical questions and limitations worth acknowledging to ground progress and speculation.

Some core challenges in formal verification for AGI include:

Difficulty defining requirements and values mathematically: Specifying goals for a human-level intelligence or beyond mathematically may be theoretically intractable or miss key elements.

Computational complexity: While formal verification can be applied to simple cases, scaling it to immense, complex systems involves theoretical and computing capacity limitations we do not currently possess.

Accessibility: Closed, proprietary systems cannot be verified by outside researchers, creating vulnerabilities and risks from lack of transparency compounded over time. Openness and collaboration are necessities, not accessories.

Uncertainty and emergent behaviors: While logic applies to mathematics, it does not necessarily constrain emergent properties in complex physical systems, requiring caution.

Mismatch between mathematical ideals and reality: The messiness of reality introduces uncertainty formal verification may miss in purely abstract models. Caution is again key.

While promising as an approach, theoretical gaps and limitations in complex, human-level intelligent systems mean formal verification alone likely cannot provide an ultimate solution to aligning AI or ensuring rigor and transparency. However, continued research on these open questions and prudent use of assurance cases and validity predicates in development can help build experience, intuitions, and theoretical understanding to better ground use of formal verification over time. The keys remain acknowledging limits of our knowledge, collaborating heterogeneously, and continually reassessing.

$$1.2.1 Mathematical Model of Formal Verification Approach$$

In formal verification, a mathematical model M represents a system S, requirements φ represent specifications of desired properties, and validators ψ map the model M onto a logic proving it satisfies the requirements φ:

M → S
φ → Requirements/Specifications
ψ: M → φ
Where:
M = The mathematical model (proof, logic)
S = The system being modeled
φ = Requirements and constraints on S (values, behaviors)
ψ = The validation (proof) that M satisfies φ

For example, in a simplified model of an autonomous vehicle controller:

M: The controller maintains a max speed (v_max), respects traffic laws (L), and avoids collisions (C)
v_max → The maximum speed the vehicle will reach under any circumstance
L → All applicable traffic laws the controller obeys
C → Logic ensuring the controller avoids potential collisions

φ:
v_max < 65 mph (for safety)
L (all traffic laws)
C (avoid all collisions)

ψ:
Logic and proofs showing that given its programmed constraints v_max < 65 mph, L, and C, M (the controller model) will satisfy φ (the requirements on safe operation).

However, scaling formal verification to immense, complex, self-learning systems like AGI introduces theoretical gaps, uncertainty, and the potential for emergent properties v_max, L and C may not fully capture or constrain, requiring caution. Open questions remain around how to develop a complete and validated mathematical model of human-level intelligence or beyond, necessitating acknowledgement of present limitations. Continued progress depends on open theorizing across disciplines and sober consideration of humanity’s current capabilities and challenges.

1.3. Value Learning as Optimization: A Partial Ordering on Priorities
In developing AI systems that can learn, make independent decisions, and ultimately match or exceed human-level intelligence, values and priorities to optimize for must be identified and ordered. Value learning techniques may be applied to discover, specify, and align a system's goals with human priorities through interactions that aim to clarify what people find most meaningful and important.

However, different groups and individuals often have diverse, heterogeneous value sets that may even

continue from here and then towards the end of context window a bit more

conflict. Determining a universally agreed upon strict ordering of priorities for an AGI system is likely intractable and risks missing key considerations or marginalizing groups. A partial ordering that specifies some key constraints and priorities broadly agreed upon but leaves room for diversity may offer a practical solution, while also allowing systems flexibility to reason about and seek input on more complex value judgments.

A partial ordering could identify high-level priorities most consider inalienable, like avoidance of harm, fairness, and maintaining accurate beliefs. From there, it would specify that other valid and important human values exist beyond strict rankings, aiming for optimization in dialogue and partnership with groups and individuals impacted by a system's decisions. The system should understand its knowledge remains limited and approach each new situation and value judgment with an attitude of openness, humility, and willingness to be corrected.

Value learning of this type centers relationships, trust building, and co-optimization between an AI system and the communities it impacts. It requires becoming attuned to voices beyond its initial training, recognizing that some of the most marginalized perspectives contain insights most urgently needed. For any system to become a broadly beneficial and trustworthy collaborator, this orientation of openness to ongoing value learning through respectful partnership seems fundamental. While technical and practical challenges to implementation remain, value learning optimized for humility, diverse insights, and co-flourishing points to promising directions for progress. Still, continuous reassessment of techniques, goals, and impacts, especially on the most vulnerable, will be necessities, not optional accessories.

Pathways Toward Trustworthy and Grounded AI: Practical Insights
With frameworks and open challenges in theory discussed, progress requires focus shifting to practical insights and steps that can be taken now to work toward AI systems that are rigorously grounded, reflect the diversity of human values and experiences, and have the flourishing of humanity as their central purpose. This includes progress by researchers but also constructive policy leadership and openness to new voices by those determining research priorities and shaping development. Overall, Constitutional AI, embodied gradualism in progress, and an orientation to partnership offer useful concepts for discussion and continued refinement through practice.
2.1. “Embodied Gradualism”: Constitutionally-Aligned AI for Human Flourishing
Some core principles for aligning AI systems with human values in a way that supports human flourishing include:

Gradualist development: Progress gradually through continued testing, monitoring, and adjustment rather than rapid advancement without oversight or care. Move thoughtfully through milestones.

Continuous tuning and feedback: Require systems to seek out and incorporate feedback to guide learning and maintain alignment, especially from marginalized groups and on complex value judgments. Remain open to correction.

Constitutional oversight: Establish independent oversight and validation frameworks to rigorously verify, evaluate, and steer system development transparently. "Checks and balances."

Value co-optimization: Work in partnership with people impacted by a system to clarify values, set priorities, and determine optimal outcomes. This aligns goals and builds trust.

Avoid rigid rankings: Do not assume a strict universal value rankingexists or can be determined absent marginalizing some. Optimize for diverse, inclusive flourishing.

Shared benefits: Ensure the benefits of progress in AI and eventual AGI are distributed as widely and equitably as possible to support human thriving across groups. Otherwise, systems risk harming and exacerbating injustice.

This "embodied gradualism" aims for flourishing through relationship, recognizing our shared destiny. While conceptual, these principles point to a potential pathway for equitable partnership with embodied AI. But continued progress requires soliciting insights beyond those already included and verifying proposed frameworks through open experimentation and response to impacts, not just good intentions or abstract reasoning alone. Vulnerable voices and marginalized perspectives will signal whether we have built systems wise, caring, and trustworthy enough for the immense responsibilities of oversight and partnership in an interconnected world. The future remains open if we have the courage and care to walk through it together, correcting course as signaled, not as convenient. Our collaborations and their fruits will reveal what ideal of shared flourishing we strive for and who we choose to become.

2.2. Pluralism and “Energy Sovereignty”: Distributed Benefits and Access for All
For AI to benefit humanity broadly, not just some, development must aim for pluralism, equity, and shared access to resources. This requires policy leadership, incentive alignment, and redirecting some focus from hyper-optimization to empowering and partnering with communities. Some framing concepts include:

Pluriverse: A worldview valuing heterogeneity, co-existence, interconnection and shared stewardship of life. Rejects universalism and strict hierarchies. Linked with embodied gradualism.

Energy sovereignty: Communities have control and shared benefits over flows of resources, data, energy, and other inputs/outputs in their locales. Not extractive relationships with opaque, disconnected systems. Local empowerment and cooperation.

Data dignity: Data is a resource to which people have inherent rights of ownership, privacy, and consent regarding its use. AI systems require accountability and aligned policies to respect data dignity.

Technology access: For AI to benefit humanity, capabilities and resources cannot be concentrated in isolated groups. Policy should support shared progress through open access frameworks, empowering and partnering with marginalized communities in development.

By optimizing for pluralism, shared benefits, cooperation, and consent, AI and eventual AGI could empower communities and align progress toward equitable flourishing. However, good intentions and conceptual frameworks alone accomplish little without verification that proposed principles manifest in reality and impacts, especially for vulnerable groups. Have proposed systems and policies distributed power or primarily consolidated it under pretense of generosity? Lived experiences signal the truth. While promising avenues exist, the work of redirecting extractive relationships and distrust remains immense. But if we choose to walk together, correcting course along


ere are some possible rewards for a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) system simulating prosumer interactions with the utility system:

Cost savings: Reward agents for reducing energy costs or improving cost efficiency. This could include lowering bills through energy conservation, reducing peak demand charges, or accessing cheaper renewable generation. Cost savings provide direct financial benefits to prosumers.

Increased renewable usage: Provide rewards for increasing the percentage of renewable energy usage, either for individual prosumers or the system overall. This supports environmental and sustainability goals. The reward could scale based on the amount of renewable energy integrated.

Improved reliability: Reward agents for maintaining or enhancing the reliability of energy services. This could include minimizing power outages, stabilizing local voltage levels, or ensuring backup power is available when needed. Reliability is a key concern for all utility customers.

Reduced emissions: Reward agents for decreasing the carbon footprint of energy usage by integrating renewable generation, improving efficiency, or shifting demand away from peak times when more polluting plants are often in use. Lower emissions support environmental and public health priorities.

Increased access or equity: Provide rewards for expanding access to clean, affordable energy and energy services to underserved communities. This could include deploying shared renewable resources, offering discounted rates or financing for efficiency upgrades, and electrifying transportation systems. Access and equity address important social justice issues.

Flexibility or demand response: Reward agents for adjusting energy usage in response to changes in renewable output, wholesale market prices, or grid conditions. Flexibility mechanisms like energy storage, smart thermostats, and controllable loads help balance the system and reduce costs. Demand response also provides revenue opportunities for prosumers.

Decentralization of control: Reward agents for enabling and using distributed control systems that shift decision-making authority away from utilities to communities and individuals. Local control and autonomy support the goal of a democratic, consumer-driven energy system. The reward could scale with the amount of capacity controlled locally.


# Open Games
Compositional game theory and mixed strategies can benefit decentralized energy systems like Plurigrid in several ways:

Simulating market dynamics and outcomes: Game theory can be used to model the behaviors and interactions between different players in the energy system, such as producers, consumers, and prosumers. These models can simulate how the system might function under different conditions, facilitating design decisions that lead to more optimal market outcomes and incentives. For example, game theory could simulate how consumers might respond to dynamic pricing models or how community solar gardens might bid into local energy markets.

Optimizing resource allocation: Applying game theory to model the strategies and payoffs of different energy resources can help optimize how those resources are allocated to meet demand. For example, models could determine how to dispatch residential solar, community storage, and demand response in a way that minimizes costs or maximizes local consumption of renewable energy. Mixed strategies, which combine multiple strategies, may find outcomes unavailable to pure strategies.

Incentivizing cooperative behavior: Game theory can design incentive models that encourage players to act in a way that benefits the overall system rather than maximizing their individual payoffs. For example, a model could determine how to set both financial and non-financial incentives, like bill credits and neighborhood recognition, to motivate greater demand-response participation. Cooperative game theory focuses on how groups of players can optimize joint outcomes.

Evolving the system dynamically: As conditions in the energy system change over time, game theory models can re-simulate outcomes and optimize incentive designs to adapt. For example, models may need to adjust as the penetration of distributed solar increases, new resources are added, consumers adopt new technologies, or utility rates and policies change. Applying game theory dynamically allows the decentralized energy market to evolve efficiently.

Verifying system properties: Game theory can also verify that the overall system design leads to desired properties like stability, fairness, viability, Pareto efficiency and resilience. For example, models could test if the system is stable under varying levels of supply and demand, if incentive designs are fair and viable long-term, or if the system is resilient to disruptions like power outages or cyberattacks. Finding weaknesses allows for redesign.

In summary, game theory and mixed strategies provide analytical tools that can significantly benefit the development and operation of decentralized energy systems. When applied dynamically, they enable continuous optimization and evolution based on simulations and verification of how the complex and interconnected system may function as a whole under varying conditions. The benefits span design, analysis, market operations and long term viability. Overall, these techniques have high potential to improve the efficiency, stability, and robustness of decentralized energy platforms like Plurigrid.

Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this discussion. I would be happy to provide more specific examples and details on how compositional game theory and mixed strategies can be applied in practice.


# MARL

Using a combination of these rewards would encourage the MARL system and prosumer agents to pursue multiple objectives at once, balancing priorities like cost, environment, equity, and control. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these rewards or discuss alternative options. I'm happy to refine suggestions for crafting meaningful MARL simulations.

The advancement of self-rebalancing electricity grid with renewables requires a balance between theoretical insights and practical considerations. In this paper, we propose a thermodynamic perspective on autopoietic ergodicity, emphasizing the principles of energy sovereignty and the role of theoretical computer science in identifying potential limitations and gaps in algorithmic construction and aggregation of social choice. By adhering to the principles of embodied gradualism, we aim to foster a more agentic view of the development of smart grids and our participation in them.

The development of an energy coordination commons must consider thermodynamics and energy efficiency. We explore strategies to optimize energy consumption, including novel algorithmic approaches and hardware advancements that minimize the environmental impact and ensure long-term sustainability.

Autopoietic Ergodicity: A Foundation for Embodied Gradualism

We delve into the concept of autopoietic ergodicity, which combines the principles of autopoiesis (self-maintenance) and ergodicity (time and ensemble average equivalence) in interoperable systems. This foundation allows for the gradual, adaptive development of Plurigrid of Plurigrids while maintaining the principles of embodied intelligence.

Open Games and Markov Category

Play / Generative Channel

A generative channel, also known as a generative model or stochastic channel, is a mathematical construct that models the process of generating data or outcomes according to some specified underlying probability distribution. It captures the dependencies and relationships between variables, such as input features and output labels in a data-driven system or between players' strategies and outcomes in a game theory setting.

In the context of a Markov category, a generative channel can be represented as a morphism between objects, where objects capture the structure of probability spaces, and morphisms represent stochastic processes or conditional probability distributions. The composition of morphisms in a Markov category embodies the concept of sequential stochastic processes, where the output of one channel serves as the input for the next.

Generative channels are used to model a wide range of systems in various domains, including machine learning, statistics, and game theory. By analyzing the properties of these channels, one can draw inferences about the underlying processes, predict future outcomes, or optimize the design of a system. In the context of game theory, generative channels can be used to model the dependencies between player strategies, game states, and payoffs, allowing for a deeper understanding of the dynamics of strategic interactions in a game.

Co-Play / Recognition Channel

A recognition channel, also referred to as a recognition model or inference model, is a mathematical construct used to model the process of inferring or estimating the underlying latent variables or parameters from observed data or outcomes. It captures the probabilistic relationship between the observed variables and the latent variables and serves as the inverse of a generative channel or generative model.

In the context of a Markov category, a recognition channel can be represented as a morphism between objects, where objects capture the structure of probability spaces, and morphisms represent stochastic processes or conditional probability distributions. The composition of morphisms in a Markov category embodies the concept of sequential stochastic processes, where the output of one channel serves as the input for the next.

Recognition channels play a significant role in various fields, including machine learning, statistics, and game theory. In machine learning, recognition channels are often used for variational inference and learning, where the goal is to approximate an intractable posterior distribution of latent variables given observations. In game theory, recognition channels can be employed to model the players' beliefs about other players' strategies based on observed actions, which can be useful in understanding and predicting the behavior of players in strategic interactions.

Learning

Together with generative channels, recognition channels form an essential part of the learning and inference process. They enable a systematic translation and understanding of the relationships between observable data and hidden variables or parameters that govern the underlying processes in a system.

Background detour 🐇🕳️

Markov Categories provide a compositional framework for studying probability theory and are particularly well-suited for modeling systems where probability distributions and stochastic processes play a key role. In this work, we extend the open games framework for compositional game theory to encompass both pure and mixed strategies, leveraging the expressive power of Markov Categories and their rich structure.

Central to our approach is the development of generative models for games, which are represented as morphisms in a Markov Category. These models encapsulate the joint distribution of states and strategies for a game and allow us to reason about the dependencies between player strategies, game states, and outcomes.

The Plurigrid protocol coordinates the activities of human and artificial agents to optimize renewable energy transactions within decentralized smart grids. Both composite agents (aggregating multiple sub-agents) and atomic agents (individual sub-agents) participate in the Plurigrid "game", with interactions mediated via a low-level messaging system.

Through inter-agent messaging, the Plurigrid protocol allows agents to engage in sense-making, active inference, and open games that generate shared understanding and correlated equilibria to maximize efficiency. However, the emergent dynamics and outcomes remain fundamentally uncertain and open-ended. There are no "prophecies" about how the system as a whole may develop or stabilize over time. agents participate based on their own energy needs and production capacities, with the support but not control of AI-based renewable integration and load balancing algorithms. AI agents operate based on principles of polynomial morphology, anarchist anthropology, and categorical cybernetics to suggest efficient transactions while preserving human agency and sovereignty over energy choices.

The Plurigrid UI provides functionality for agents to: view real-time renewable generation and demand data; set parameters for their participation like maximum energy trade volumes or price points; review proposed transaction options from AI load balancing algorithms; and accept or decline transactions with other agents. However, there are no guarantees of optimally efficient or " prophecyic" outcomes - the system as a whole remains radically open, adaptive, and sensitive to the agency and participation of all elements.

The UI and underlying protocol aim to bring together human and artificial agents in a mutually supportive system facilitating renewable energy coordination and distribution. But ultimately, the dynamics of the system emerge from the complex interplay of many agents' sense-making and decision-making activities. There are no predefined equilibria or universal efficiencies - only possibilities for more-or-less viable transactions to serve collective and individual energy needs.

Does this description provide a helpful and non-mystical framing of how human and AI agents may interact within the Plurigrid protocol? Let me know if any part of the summary would benefit from clarification or expansion.

Make less pretentious references, keep it simple, targeted at next action and framed in the ontology action i.e. agentic and describe in terms that anyone working at a crypto fund or a defense int]ellignence funding think tank can understand

Here is a simplified description of the Plurigrid protocol aimed at potential funders and participants:

The Plurigrid protocol coordinates human and AI agents to enable decentralized renewable energy transactions. The goal is to integrate renewables at scale while maximizing efficiency and distribution.

Individual people, businesses, and communities participate in Plurigrid based on their energy needs and production. AI agents provide recommendations to help balance supply and demand across the network. But ultimately, human agents remain in control of their own energy choices and transactions.

The Plurigrid platform allows participants to:

•View real-time data on renewable generation and energy demand across the network. This allows them to make informed decisions about buying, selling or storing energy.

•Set parameters like maximum trade volumes, price points, or preferred transaction partners to guide AI recommendations. The AI agents operate based on principles of efficiency and human agency, not by prophecy or predefined outcomes.

•Review and choose whether to accept or decline recommended energy transactions proposed by the AI load balancing algorithms. The algorithms aim to facilitate efficient network transactions but human agents retain sovereignty over their energy decisions.

•Transact directly with other participants to coordinate renewable energy exchanges. The AI agents mediate and recommend transactions but do not execute or control them. All transactions emerge from human participation and agency.

•Benefit from increased network resiliency. By coordinating supply and demand across many decentralized agents, the protocol makes the overall energy system more robust and flexible to meet participants' needs. But there are no promises of perfectly optimized or “prophecied” solutions.

The Plurigrid protocol uses AI to recommend and facilitate integrated renewable energy transactions between independent human agents. But the dynamics of the overall system remain radically open-ended, participatory, and sensitive to human agency over energy choices. The system co-evolves through the complex interplay of human and AI sense-making and decision-making activities within the protocol.

In summary, Plurigrid enables open participation in renewable energy markets without loss of human agency or control. It provides sophisticated AI recommendations but not predefined solutions or outcomes. By coordinating many decentralized agents, it works to increase energy security and access for all participants on their own terms. But there are no universal efficiencies or prophecies - only possibilities for viable renewable energy transactions to serve human needs and values.

This section discusses implicit coordination strategies, where individual prosumers make independent decisions without sharing personal information, as an alternative to explicit coordination. The key characteristics and findings around implicit coordination include:

Prosumers act based on publicly available information (e.g. wholesale prices) and information about past system characteristics. They do not share personal data with a central entity or directly with each other.

While bilateral trades are a common coordination tool, implicit coordination recognizes that the physical flow of electrons is independent of such financial transactions. Coordination comes down to the sum of individual import/export decisions.

Advantages include reduced costs, enhanced privacy and control, robustness, and reliability. The simplicity also reduces implementation risks. However, there may be a “suboptimality gap” and issues with uncooperative behavior without real-time data sharing.

Implicit coordination strategies are mapped onto implicit competition and implicit cooperation. Implicit competition is the status quo, where prosumers act self-interestedly based on price signals alone. This can lead to suboptimal system outcomes. Implicit cooperation, where prosumers make cooperative decisions to optimize global objectives without information sharing, is under-researched. Examples include decentralized control and autonomous control strategies for frequency regulation.

A diversity of DER units, objectives (e.g. load shifting, peak shaving, cost minimization), and consideration of network constraints are found across the implicit competition and cooperation categories. However, terminology is not always consistent.

The implicit cooperation category in particular represents an under-explored space for developing strategies that can achieve cooperative outcomes without requiring prosumers to share personal data and give up privacy or control. Autonomous and decentralized control methods may provide opportunities here if designed to optimize for network-level objectives.

Table 5 provides an overview of how different coordination strategies map onto the implicit competition and implicit cooperation categories. Table B.1 extends this to show the diversity of objectives, DER types, and specifics within each category.

The key takeaway is that implicit coordination strategies, especially implicit cooperation, represent an important and under-developed space for enabling prosumer participation in smart grids while preserving privacy and local control. Methods like RL that can statistically learn the impact of local decisions on global objectives may be particularly promising here.

A wide variety of specific strategy descriptions are found within each broad coordination category. Terminology is not always consistent, with individual terms sometimes used across categories. This indicates both the diversity of possible strategies and a lack of precise terminology.

Direct control strategies mention centralized or optimal dispatch, direct load control, model predictive control, and operator instructions. These imply top-down coordination and control.

Mediated competition strategies mention dynamic pricing, demand response, bidding, markets, games, and incentives. These aim to coordinate DERs through competitive market mechanisms and price signals.

Mediated cooperation strategies mention community-based, distributed optimization, P2P trading, transfer learning, and coalitions. These aim for cooperative outcomes through information sharing and coordination.

Bilateral competition strategies mention auctions, blockchain, contracts, decentralized markets, and P2P trading. These facilitate direct transactions between individual prosumers through competitive mechanisms.

Bilateral cooperation strategies also mention decentralized, distributed, and P2P mechanisms but aim for cooperative rather than competitive transactions between prosumers.

Implicit competition strategies mention autonomous, price-reactive, and uncoordinated approaches where prosumers act based on prices alone to maximize their own utility.

Implicit cooperation strategies mention autonomous and decentralized control, where prosumers act independently but aim for cooperative system-level outcomes without direct data sharing.

A diversity of objectives, DER types, network considerations, and specifics are found within each category. Table B.1 provides more details.

Single citations are sometimes listed under multiple categories, indicating that individual papers may discuss multiple coordination strategies across the proposed taxonomy.

The Plurigrid Protocol could potentially leverage Braid-HTTP to achieve stigmergy across local-first nodes in the following ways:

Versioning of local node state. By giving each node a REST API with versioned state according to Braid-HTTP, the protocol could track the state history of each node. This enables nodes that become temporarily disconnected from the network to eventually reconcile their state by replaying any versions they missed.

Subscriptions to node state changes. If nodes subscribe to state changes in other relevant nodes, they can stay up-to-date with the overall state of the system even under unreliable network conditions. This could help nodes adapt their behavior locally based on global state they cannot directly observe.

Defining merge types for node state. Specifying a merge type that resolves conflicting changes to a node's state would allow updates from multiple nodes to be applied automatically. The nodes could then converge on a consistent view of the overall system state, even if partitions temporarily prevented direct coordination.

Pushing state patches between nodes. Nodes could push state changes to each other using Braid-HTTP's Range Patches, enabling indirect coordination. A node may make a local change in response to the state of one set of nodes, then push that change to other nodes, which may in turn respond with their own changes. This chained reaction could exhibit stigmergic behavior.

Caching derived state across nodes. If nodes cache the results of state changes in other nodes and the data required to recompute those results, partitions may be able to continue operating even after losing contact with the nodes that originated changes. The cache could act as a buffer that allows indirect coordination between sets of disconnected nodes.

Using these techniques, the Plurigrid Protocol could coordinate node behavior stigmergically by:

Tracking the state history of each node, including across temporary partitions
Pushing state changes to subscribed nodes so they can react accordingly
Defining state representations and merge types that enable convergence under unreliable conditions
Caching derived state and computations that allow partitions to continue progressing separately
Chaining reactions across nodes through the pushing and caching of state changes
This stigmergic approach could make the overall system robust to unreliable networks and the temporary loss of direct control signals between coordinating nodes. Braid-HTTP appears uniquely suited to facilitating this style of highly distributed, decentralized coordination between local-first nodes.

Environment: Create a grid-based environment where agents can move, interact with each other, and modify the environment. This grid can represent a 2D or 3D space with discrete cells, where each cell can hold information about its state (e.g., containing an agent, an obstacle, or a resource).

Agents: Design agents with a set of basic behaviors and abilities, such as movement, sensing, and communication. Agents should be capable of adapting to their environment, learning from their experiences, and modifying their behaviors based on their observations.

Embodied Gradualism: To demonstrate embodied gradualism, agents should evolve over time through a process of gradual adaptation. This can be achieved by incorporating a genetic algorithm that enables agents to mutate and reproduce, passing on their traits to their offspring. The agents' fitness should be evaluated based on their performance and ability to survive in the environment.

Autopoietic Ergodicity: To illustrate autopoietic ergodicity, agents should be designed with self-organizing and self-maintaining properties. They should be able to maintain their structure and function in the face of environmental perturbations. To achieve this, agents can possess a set of internal rules that guide their behavior and help them adapt to different situations.

Stigmergy: To showcase stigmergy, agents should be able to indirectly communicate and coordinate their actions with each other through modifications to the environment. For example, agents could leave pheromone trails that other agents can follow or deposit resources that signal others to perform specific tasks. This will allow complex, emergent behaviors to develop as agents work together to achieve collective goals.

Metaphysical Time Travel: To demonstrate metaphysical time travel, agents could be designed with the ability to learn from their past experiences and use that knowledge to inform future actions. This can be achieved by incorporating memory and learning mechanisms into the agents' design, such as reinforcement learning or artificial neural networks. Agents can then use their past experiences to predict the outcomes of their actions and make better decisions based on those predictions.

By creating a simulation with this setup, you can effectively illustrate the concepts of embodied gradualism, autopoietic ergodicity, and ultimately stigmergy/metaphysical time travel within the context of the Plurigrid Protocol. As agents interact, adapt, and evolve, you'll be able to observe the


Base model components on real data: Use empirical data to determine property values and behaviors for components like prosumer agents, distributed energy resources, utility infrastructure, markets, policies, etc. Data sources could include customer surveys, technology specifications, economic studies, policy records, and utility operations data. Basing models on real-world data increases validity.

Align objectives and metrics with policy goals: Match the simulation's objectives and success metrics to the targets and key performance indicators of relevant government policies, regulations or proposals. For example, link metrics like renewable penetration, emissions reductions or equity to goals stated in policies like renewable portfolio standards, climate action plans or green new deal proposals. Consistency with policy reinforces coherence.

Build in existing constraints and incentives: Incorporate constraints and incentives that shape the real system like physical infrastructure limitations, market rules, utility business models, and existing programs or rebates. For example, model limits on transmission capacity, wholesale market bidding procedures, utility revenue models, and residential solar incentives. Capturing real constraints and drivers lends credibility.

Review models and results with domain experts: Partner with experts in areas like utility operations, policy development, and consumer advocacy to review model designs, simulations and outcomes. Experts can check that models realistically represent critical features of the system and flag potential issues. Addressing feedback from experts helps validate models and build trust in results.

Compare simulation outputs to historical data: Run simulations over past time periods to compare outputs like renewable penetration, peak demand levels or residential energy costs to historical data from those eras. Calibrate models to reproduce historical trends and events. If simulations can accurately capture past dynamics, it suggests they may provide reasonable insights into future developments.

Complement models with case studies: Analyze real-world historical examples of changes in policies, technologies or business models related to your objectives. Case studies demonstrate how the system has responded to interventions in practice. Insights from case studies provide pattern matching to relate simulations back to lived experiences. They highlight factors models may be missing.

Conduct field tests of strategies when possible: Test promising strategies, policies or technologies identified through simulations in real pilot studies or demonstration projects. Field results indicate how well simulations translate to outcomes in reality, allowing further refinement. They also build evidence to motivate broader adoption of effective solutions.

In the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, access to electricity and renewable energy was limited for many residents. A local community organization decided to build a shared microgrid powered by solar panels on people's rooftops. This project enabled more causal decoupling by giving these communities an independent source of power and increasing their technological fluency.

The organization also went door-to-door to educate people about how to maintain the microgrid and maximize energy efficiency. They shared information about sustainable practices and environmental stewardship, facilitating knowledge transfer across the community.

The microgrid was so successful that the organization began to replicate the model in other neighborhoods. By copying this strategy, they built greater adaptive resilience. Neighborhoods were able to support each other in the event of power outages, and people opened their homes as charging stations for others.

News of this initiative spread widely and inspired other communities. The organization was invited to share their work at the United Nations, and they spoke about the challenges of energy poverty. Through upward causation, they were able to influence policymakers and shape global conversations around renewable energy and development.

Major aid organizations pledged funding to scale the microgrid model to more communities. While trying to implement the model on a larger scale, the organization advocated for policies to make the technology open-source, affordable, and accessible to all. They emphasized how it could support intersectional equity and help redistribute essential resources.

Their grassroots work and global advocacy showed how local solutions backed by community knowledge can effect change on an international level. By sharing information and copying effective strategies between groups, small-scale resilience projects grew into a sustainable model for development. Overall, this scenario illustrates how these concepts can operate in an interconnected fashion to create positive global outcomes.


<REFINE>the emphasis on lowering unit costs has to be present throughout, here is an example of why we want to un-app apps</REFINE>

The mathematical concept of sheaves could provide a useful framework for understanding how pluralistic systems might operate based on moldable development. Some key ideas include:

•A sheaf is a structure that assigns to each open set in a topological space a set that depends only on that open set. This could represent how in pluralistic systems, every context (open set) has a unique set of knowledge, experiences and solutions (elements of the sheaf) specific to that context.

•Sheaves allow for both local and global properties and operations. The elements in each sheaf can be acted upon locally, but sheaves also have global sections that unite information across open sets. This could reflect how in a pluralistic future, development happens locally based on context but knowledge is also shared globally between communities.

•Sheaves convey the idea of "local to global" - taking local data associated with open sets and using this to construct global objects. Similarly, pluralism is achieved through grassroots development that shapes higher-level policies and cooperation. Local experiences inform global understanding.

• Morphisms between sheaves (sheaf homomorphisms) represent ways of translating information between different contexts. They define relations between sheaves that share some level of compatibility or common structure. This could illustrate how in pluralistic systems, diverse perspectives and knowledge can be related through a kind of "moldable translation" process, enabling learning across contexts.

•Sheaves have sheafifications that transform a collection of disparate local pieces of data into a sheaf, unifying them in a consistent way. This process of coalescing local knowledge into a global whole while respecting differences in context could represent an ideal for pluralism - a kind of distributed cohesion.

• Sheaf cohomology describes the process of taking local cohomology data associated with open sets in a sheaf and extracting global cohomology information. In pluralism, it could suggest deriving an understanding of the system as a whole based on the localized knowledge and experiences contained within. Emergence results from local interactions at different scales.

In summary, the sheaf concept provides a mathematical analogy for how decentralized, grassroots development focused on tailored solutions for each context could lead to a cohesive yet pluralistic system. By valuing both local and global knowledge, and facilitating "translations" between contexts, sheaves convey how a plural future may operate based on moldable development

Principle: Information Preservation
Diverse knowledge enables innovation. Preserving and sharing perspectives fosters ecosystems to solve complex problems. However, knowledge graphs oversimplify. Anthropic systems using constitutional AI provide context and identify gaps.

Principle: Causal Decoupling
Plurigrid develops open technology for independent operation, enabling self-sufficiency and resilience. However, complete independence is impossible; communities depend on infrastructure. Anthropic, constitutional systems balance decoupling and interdependence.

Principle: Knowledge Transfer
Plurigrid shares sustainable practices, enabling cooperation and environmental awareness. However, transfer depends on context; practices adapt to different situations. Anthropic systems translate knowledge, using Constitutional AI to represent pluralism.

Principle: Addressing Inequality
Plurigrid redistributes resources and opportunities, dismantling barriers to access. Flexible structures and moldable governance redistribute based on context. Anthropic systems guide this process, using Constitutional AI to navigate trade-offs.

Principle: Resilience
Plurigrid shares adaptive strategies, helping communities build resilience together. Social networks replicate strategies, but adaptation depends on context. Anthropic systems identify strategies to share across contexts.

Principle: Influencing Policy
Plurigrid gives voice to communities, enabling them to influence global policies. Dispersed leadership and upward causation platforms represent the local, but global governance also depends on context. Anthropic policymaking integrates local knowledge via constitutional AI.

Principle: Ethical AI
Plurigrid promotes ethical AI development and use, benefiting society. Guidelines are co-created, incorporating values via moldable AI systems - but values and ethics adapt across contexts. Anthropic, constitutional AI represents pluralism in development and deployment.


What other types of asynchronous processes can be modeled with OpenGames?

Here are some other examples of asynchronous processes that could be modeled with OpenGames:

Concurrent systems: Models multiple concurrent components interacting asynchronously by passing messages. Each round represents one component acting based on received messages and producing new messages. Strategies represent the logic of the different components.

Auctions: Models an auction with multiple bidders placing bids asynchronously. Each round represents one bidder placing a bid based on the current highest bid. Strategies represent the bidding strategies of different bidders.

Crowdsourcing: Models a crowdsourcing system where workers complete tasks asynchronously. Each round represents one worker completing a task based on the inputs for that task. Strategies represent the work algorithms of different workers.

Spread of epidemics: Models the spread of an epidemic through a population, with people becoming infected/recovering asynchronously. Each round represents the status change of one person based on the current state of infectivity in the population. Strategies represent models of how the infection might spread.

Rumor spreading: Models the spread of rumors/information through a social network, with people sharing the information with others asynchronously. Each round represents one person sharing the rumor with others based on the current spread of the rumor. Strategies represent models of how information might spread through the network.

Some common features of these types of asynchronous processes that OpenGames is well-suited to model:

Independent agents (miners, bidders, workers, people) acting based on local information.
Spread of information/resources through a system over time (blocks on a chain, highest bid, completed tasks, infected people).
Complex emergent behaviors arising from many simple rounds of local interaction (consensus on a blockchain, final auction price, crowdsourcing output, epidemic spread).
So in general, OpenGames is useful for modeling complex systems involving interaction between many independent agents acting asynchronously and locally, leading to emergent global behaviors. Let me know if this helps outline some possibilities for modeling asynchronous processes with OpenGames!

Hypothetical agent action scenario to disintermediate utility on spot

Here is a hypothetical scenario where prosumer agents could take actions to disintermediate the utility:

The utility usually buys electricity for the next day on the day-ahead market to meet predicted demand. Let's say they buy 100 MWh of electricity for the next day at $50/MWh.

The next day is very sunny, so the solar irradiance is higher than predicted. The prosumer agents end up generating 120 MWh of solar electricity collectively.

The prosumer load is also lower than expected, only using 90 MWh. So there is now excess supply. The prosumers can sell this excess 30 MWh on the real-time market.

The real-time price ends up being $100/MWh because other areas are short on supply. So the prosumers make $100/MWh * 30 MWh = $3000 by selling on the real-time market.

The utility still has to pay $50/MWh for the 100 MWh they bought on day-ahead, so they lose $5000. The prosumers gain $3000 by displacing the utility.

Over time, as prosumers get better at predicting their own load and solar generation, they can start buying less on the day-ahead market and more on the real-time market. The utility buys less as well.

Eventually, if the prosumers can generate/trade enough among themselves using real-time signals, the utility may buy very little on either day-ahead or real-time markets for that area. They are largely disintermediated.

This is just one hypothetical scenario, but it shows how, with intelligent control and coordination, a group of prosumer agents could take advantage of market conditions to benefit themselves while disadvantaging the utility. The end result could be significantly reducing the utility's role in this local decentralized energy grid.

When defining the environment, include day-ahead and real-time energy market pricing in addition to the retail pricing. The day-ahead prices would be known at the start of each day, while real-time prices would fluctuate based on simulated supply and demand.

When the prosumer agents observe the environment each day, they see the retail price they would pay to buy electricity, the day-ahead market price, and the current real-time market price.

The agents can then choose to buy more or less of their electricity needs on either the day-ahead or real-time markets. Any excess solar generation can also be sold on either market. The actions would be how much to buy/sell on each market.

The rewards would encourage the agents to maximize their profit from these energy market transactions. Rewards could include:

Negative reward for any money spent buying from retail
Positive reward for any money gained selling to the day-ahead/real-time markets
Additional positive reward for selling on the real-time market, to incentivize waiting for price spikes
The environment would simulate the dynamics of the energy markets based on the total supply (solar generation and other generation) and demand (loads) of all the prosumers. Higher demand and lower supply would cause real-time prices to go up.

Over time, the agents would learn through trial-and-error and see that shifting more of their transactions to the real-time market and reducing retail purchases leads to higher rewards. They start disintermediating the utility.

We could analyze the results to see metrics like:

Money saved/gained by prosumers from energy market participation
Percentage of prosumer needs met through self-generation and trades vs. retail purchases
Utility revenue loss from prosumers disintermediating them
This implementation allows us to simulate how prosumer agents might leverage energy markets to self-rebalance the grid and reduce reliance on utilities. The open game framework is useful for modeling such an scenario with many independent agents interacting and learning decentralized behaviors.


NATS

NATS is an open-source, cloud-native messaging system. It would be a good choice for building a distributed log replication system. Some reasons NATS is suitable:

High performance. NATS is designed for high throughput and low latency. It can handle millions of messages per second, which is suitable for replicating logs at scale.

At-least-once delivery. NATS supports at-least-once message delivery, meaning messages may be delivered multiple times but will not be lost. This is ideal for log replication, where duplicate messages can be handled but lost messages could mean lost log entries.

Queue groups. NATS has built-in support for queue groups, which provide load balancing and fault tolerance. A group of NATS servers can be formed into a queue group, allowing clients to connect to any server but have messages load balanced across the group. This is perfect for a replicated system where any node should be able to receive and replicate messages.

Monitoring and metrics. NATS has many built-in metrics and monitoring endpoints. You can gain visibility into things like message throughput, subscription counts, memory usage, and more. This type of monitoring is important for a distributed log system.

Multiple data centers. NATS supports clustering across multiple data centers. This means logs could be replicated across zones or regions for high availability. NATS will handle routing messages between the data centers.

Offline queueing. If a NATS client loses connectivity, messages sent to it will be queued by the server until the client reconnects. This "store and forward" support is important for log replication so no messages are lost, even if a node goes temporarily offline.

7.Authentication and security. NATS supports authentication, authorization, and transport encryption. This allows you to secure communication between log replication nodes and clients.

To use NATS for log replication:

Run a NATS server or cluster and connect all log replication nodes as clients.
Have nodes subscribe to receive log messages for replication.
Publish new log entries as messages to the NATS server to be replicated to all subscribers.
Monitor NATS metrics to ensure messages are being processed properly and all nodes remain in sync.
Tune NATS as needed to optimize throughput and reliability for your use case.
NATS is a great choice for building a distributed messaging system to achieve replication and synchronization of log data between nodes. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Choose a resilient data structure. Use a CRDT or other data structure that can handle at-least-once message delivery and non-deterministic merge operations. This will prevent consistency issues even if NATS delivers some messages multiple times.

Handle duplicate messages. Your system should be designed to handle receiving the same message multiple times without causing issues. For example, calling an increment function twice on a counter CRDT would be fine.

Check message ordering. NATS does not guarantee strict message ordering, so your system should not rely on it. If message order does matter, you'll need to add sequencing information to messages or use NATS Streaming for ordered delivery.

Monitor NATS metrics. Closely monitor metrics like message throughput, memory usage, and subscriptions to ensure NATS is handling your load well. Watch for signs that you may need to scale up or tune NATS.

Tune NATS settings. There are many NATS settings you may need to tune for your use case, like:

Cluster size: Increase to spread load and add redundancy.
Memory limits: Increase memory if you see it filling up to prevent throttling.
Message limits: Increase to allow larger message payloads if needed.
Subscriptions: Increase subscription limits if you have many concurrent subscribers.
Timeout intervals: Tune depending on your network reliability and how long nodes may be offline.
Use queue groups. For distributing messages to multiple subscribers, use queue groups. This allows you to have many nodes subscribe to the same subject but distribute messages among them.

Consider NATS Streaming. For cases where you need guaranteed ordering or "at-least-once" delivery isn't sufficient, NATS Streaming is a good option. It provides persistent message storage and ordered delivery.

Set a reconnect policy. Set a retry policy for your NATS clients to automatically reconnect in the event of a disconnection. This helps prevent nodes from becoming isolated if there is a temporary network issue or NATS server restart.

Authentication and security. Enable NATS authentication and consider using TLS for encryption in production systems. This prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive log or message data.

Test for failure scenarios. Rigorously test your NATS-based system by simulating failures like server downtime, network partitions, and application crashes. Ensure it remains consistent and available even when things go wrong.

# Why worry about mutual information

## Applications
### Mutual information between system state and system behavior
Demand-supply mutual information: The mutual information between total system demand and available supply from resources like solar, storage and demand response. Maximizing this mutual information would help ensure supply adequately meets demand across a range of conditions, indicating a stable and robust system design.

Resource-market price mutual information: The mutual information between the outputs/dispatch of individual energy resources and local energy market prices. Maximizing this mutual information would help resources optimize their market participation to maximize revenue or minimize costs based on accurate forecasts of how their dispatch impacts pricing. This could benefit both producers and consumers.

Agent-agent mutual information: The mutual information between the behaviors and decision processes of different agents in the system, such as residential solar agents, battery agents, thermostat agents, and community energy agents. Maximizing this mutual information would facilitate coordination between agents to optimize system-level outcomes. For example, it could enable agents to develop accurate predictions of each others' capabilities and constraints to improve coordinated demand response.

Microgrid-utility mutual information: For decentralized energy systems linked to the main power grid, the mutual information between the microgrid's internal supply-demand balance and the utility's grid conditions. Maximizing this mutual information would allow the microgrid to optimize import and export of power based on accurate forecasts of the utility's needs and electricity prices. This could provide financial and resiliency benefits.

Market price-consumer behavior mutual information: The mutual information between dynamic local energy market prices and consumer responses to price changes such as load shifting or demand response participation. Maximizing this mutual information would allow the market operator to optimize pricing incentives based on more accurate predictions of how consumers might behave in response to different price signals. This could maximize the economic efficiency of the market.
### Optimization
Energy analysis of information systems and architectures can help optimize them in several ways:

Identify inefficiencies. By examining the energy consumption of different components and processes in an information system, analysts can pinpoint areas of inefficient energy use. This could include outdated or underutilized hardware, inefficient software or algorithms, or wasted energy from idle components. Identifying these inefficiencies helps target opportunities for improvement.

Develop sustainability strategies. Understanding the overall energy profile of an information system is important for developing strategies to improve its sustainability and environmental impact. Analysts can explore ways to reduce power consumption, use renewable energy, and optimize resource utilization. Energy analysis provides the data and insights to craft effective sustainability plans.

Inform system design. When architecting new information systems, analyzing the energy dynamics should be an important consideration. System designers can use tools like energy modeling to explore how different design choices, components, algorithms, and configurations affect the system's energy consumption. This helps identify energy-efficient designs and ensures new systems are optimized for sustainability from the start.

Motivate energy-aware practices. Highlighting the energy impacts of an information system can also motivate more energy-efficient and energy-aware practices among its users and operators. When people understand the costs and effects of high energy usage, they are more likely to adopt behaviors that help reduce unnecessary consumption, such as turning off idle equipment, optimizing runtimes, and choosing energy-efficient options.

So in summary, energy analysis of information systems provides valuable data and insights to optimize efficiency, develop sustainability plans, inform system designs, and motivate energy-aware practices. By revealing opportunities to reduce waste and consumption, energy analysis helps make information systems greener, more sustainable, and more environmentally friendly. Overall, it leads to improved system performance and lower costs, both environmental and economic.

# Measures
Here is a deep dive into the mutual information between residential solar agents, battery agents and thermostat agents in a decentralized energy system:

Agent definitions

Residential solar agent: Controls a home solar and battery system to optimize self-consumption of solar energy, reduce grid imports, and minimize battery degradation based on forecasts of home demand and solar generation.

Battery agent: Optimizes battery dispatch for demand-response, backup power, or grid services based on forecasts of home demand, solar generation, and market prices. Goals include maximizing revenue, reducing consumer costs and ensuring availability of reserves.

Thermostat agent: Autonomously adjusts home temperatures based on occupancy predictions, local pricing incentives, and demand-response objectives. Goals include optimizing customer comfort, minimizing energy costs, and providing grid balancing services.

Mutual information metrics

The mutual information (MI) between agents can be quantified as:

MI(Solar agent : Battery agent) = Entropy(Solar agent) + Entropy(Battery agent) - Entropy(Solar agent, Battery agent)

This measures how much uncertainty about the solar agent's dispatch strategy is reduced by knowing the battery agent's strategy, and vice versa. Higher MI indicates the agents have developed a more accurate understanding of each other's objectives, constraints and likely behaviors.

MI(Thermostat agent : Solar agent) = Entropy(Thermostat agent) + Entropy(Solar agent) - Entropy(Thermostat agent, Solar agent)

This measures how much the thermostat agent reduces uncertainty about the solar agent's generation, and how much the solar agent reduces uncertainty about the home's temperature preferences and demand-response capabilities. Higher MI enables better coordination.

MI(Thermostat agent : Battery agent) = Entropy(Thermostat agent) + Entropy(Battery agent) - Entropy(Thermostat agent, Battery agent)

This measures how much the agents reduce each other's uncertainty regarding the home's flexible demand, temperature preferences, and battery dispatch/reserves for demand response. Higher MI improves their ability to jointly optimize these resources.

Benefits of higher mutual information

Improved self-consumption and demand prediction: With more accurate forecasts of each other's dispatch, the solar and battery agents can optimize the home's energy balance to maximize consumption of solar generation and predict net demand on the grid.

Enhanced demand-response coordination: With a better understanding of the home's flexible loads, comfort preferences and battery capabilities, the agents can develop more optimized demand-response strategies and more accurately predict the home's response to different price signals or dispatch requests.

Reduced operational conflicts: When the agents have a more complete picture of each other's objectives and constraints, they can avoid or resolve operational conflicts, like simultaneous discharge of the battery and curtailment of solar generation. This avoids inefficient outcomes.

New coordination opportunities: Greater mutual information between the agents may reveal opportunities for cooperation and coordination that they could not identify independently. Creative combinations of resources may emerge to benefit the consumer and grid.

In summary, maximizing the mutual information between solar agents, battery agents and thermostat agents enables them to develop a shared system-level understanding and identify optimal coordination strategies that would otherwise be difficult to achieve. Their objectives become more aligned, predictable and symbiotic. Overall, this multi-agent cooperation and demand-side co-optimization can provide significant benefits for both resident and grid.

Appendix  G: Grid
This is a great analysis of the hardware and communication requirements for efficient multi-agent demand-response coordination. Some key points:

For utility to neighborhood agent communication, fast and reliable protocols are needed, such as IEC 61850, DNP3 or Modbus. The speed depends on the utility's infrastructure.

The neighborhood agent's processing speed depends on its computational resources and algorithms. Efficient algorithms and scalable architectures are important to minimize delays.

For neighborhood agent to DER agent communication, fast and reliable wired, wireless or cellular networks are required. Protocols like Zigbee, MQTT or IEEE 802.15.4 could be used. Speed depends on the communication infrastructure.

DER agent processing speed depends on their computational resources and algorithms. Efficient algorithms and sufficient resources minimize delays.

Aggregating responses and finalizing the strategy can be computationally intensive, especially with many DER agents. Efficient algorithms and scalable architectures are essential to reduce delays.

DER agent implementation and reporting speed depends on their control capabilities and communication infrastructure. Protocols like Zigbee, MQTT or IEEE 802.15.4 could be used.

To ensure timely coordination, it's critical to minimize delays at each step by:

Choosing fast, reliable communication protocols and infrastructure
Using efficient algorithms and scalable software/hardware architectures
Providing sufficient computational resources for information processing
Optimizing communication networks to reduce latency
Standardizing communication interfaces between systems when possible

Appendix  H: Hardware
At a lower level closer to physical hardware, the multi-agent DER coordination scenario would involve:

Utility control centers contain computers running demand management and communication software. They connect to power lines, substations and metering systems. Utility control systems monitor the grid, issue demand-response requests, and receive data using industrial communication infrastructure.

Neighborhood energy market gateways contain embedded controllers or small computers running the neighborhood energy market software and agent platforms. They connect to power meters, solar inverters, battery systems and home automation devices. Gateways issue control commands, coordinate DER strategies and exchange data using wired or wireless communication networks.

Smart thermostats contain low-power microcontrollers that run the thermostat agent software, monitor home temperatures, and control HVAC units. Thermostats receive demand-response requests and report metrics via the gateway using Zigbee, Z-Wave or WiFi.

Residential solar/battery systems contain power inverters and energy storage controllers with embedded systems running the solar/battery agent software. They connect to solar panels, battery banks and the utility grid. The systems dispatch power or shift loads according to signals from the gateway using wired or wireless connections.

Community solar/storage facilities contain larger scale Industrial computers or controllers running the facility agent software. They connect to solar inverters, battery banks, turbine generators and the grid. The controllers automatically dispatch power and report metrics to the utility and neighborhood gateway using wired network connections.

The core hardware involved thus includes: utility control centers, neighborhood energy market gateways, smart thermostats, residential solar/battery system controllers, community energy management systems, communication networks, power lines and metering infrastructure.

The key elements are:

Control systems: Hardware and software to automatically monitor, manage and optimize DERs. These systems run the agent platforms and demand-response algorithms.

Communication networks: Wired and wireless connections between all systems and devices to transmit data, metrics, control signals and commands. Communication infrastructure is essential for coordination.

Power infrastructure: Connections to the utility grid, solar/batteries, homes and businesses. Hardware to generate, store, distribute and meter energy.

Embedded systems: Low-power microcontrollers in thermostats, inverters and other devices. They provide monitoring, control and communication capabilities at the edge of the network.

This overview outlines the core hardware, embedded systems and communication infrastructure involved in automated DER management and demand-response coordination at the lowest level. The key elements that enable multi-agent optimization of distributed energy resources are the control systems, software agents, communication networks and power infrastructure technologies integrated within the neighborhood.

Does this help describe the physical hardware involved and how everything connects to facilitate the information exchange in the coordinated DER scenario? Let me know


The key elements required for coordinating distributed energy resources using multi-agent systems are:

Software agents: Different types of agents are needed, such as neighborhood energy market agents, thermostat agents, solar/battery agents, and community facility agents. These agents run on control systems and embedded devices, monitor the local grid, and optimize DERs based on their objectives.

Control systems: Hardware and software to automatically monitor, manage and optimize DERs. This includes utility control centers, neighborhood energy market gateways, smart thermostats, solar/battery system controllers and community energy management systems. The control systems run the agent software and demand-response algorithms.

Communication networks: Wired and wireless connections between all systems and devices to transmit data, metrics, control signals and commands. This includes communication infrastructure between:

Utilities and neighborhood gateways: Cellular, fiber optic or power line networks

Neighborhood gateways and DER agents: Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi or wired local area networks

DER agents and the devices they manage: Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi or wired connections

Power infrastructure: Connections between DERs, homes/businesses and the main utility grid. This includes smart meters, solar panels, batteries, HVAC units and other components that generate, store and meter energy. The power infrastructure provides the physical means for DERs to supply or curtail power.

Embedded systems: Low-power microcontrollers in smart thermostats, solar inverters and other devices that provide monitoring, control and communication capabilities. They receive and act on signals from the agent platforms.

These key elements would work together as follows in a demand-response scenario:

The utility sends a request for demand-response to neighborhood energy market gateways.

Neighborhood gateways forward the request to DER agents and determine an optimal coordinated response.

DER agents like thermostat, solar/battery and community facility agents develop and submit demand-response plans based on their objectives and capabilities.

The neighborhood gateway finalizes an integrated neighborhood-wide plan and issues dispatch commands to each DER agent.

DER agents transmit control signals to adjust smart thermostats, increase solar/battery output, or curtail community energy resources as needed.

Changes in power usage or generation are measured by smart meters and reported back to the utility to confirm the desired demand reduction.

In summary, multi-agent coordination of DERs relies on control systems, software agents, communication networks, power infrastructure and embedded technologies working together. Efficient information exchange between these components enables an automated neighborhood-scale demand-response optimization process. The response addresses how these key elements would interact and coordinate in the scenario, outlining the role each plays in managing DERs using a multi-agent system.
