TL;DR https://poe.com/bmorphism/1512927999916527 -- this is our current "gameplay" for transactive energy in a pluralistic world rapidly losing equilibria, what you see inside is a "microworld" - a model of lived reality used for sense-making. In effect, we are aiming to sustainably enable and discover the value of coordination via possible future simulation for sense-making, as it translates to measurable system efficiency and resilience de-risking any deployment of capital and establishing a new category of commodity-like cyberphysical asset. How? by making experience you find in the link available to everyone, on every node -- that are first and foremost going to be any device that can run our capabilities based node image. As of now, we have released v0 Alpha (this release is called Laura) -- and the prompts you see in the URL above and interactive experiences they enable (to be rendered as immersive and high resolution enough representation of the systems / networks they model).

More detail:
In the Plurigrid Protocol, the primary focus will be on the decentralized mesh/lattice network of nodes operating in a local-first, peer-to-peer configuration. The various chains, including major ecosystems, will primarily host outposts rather than the core mechanisms themselves.

Open Source. The node software (nexus) is executable on many different substrate hardware / OS sources of compute. Because of heterogeneous nature of hardware but homogeneous software image, as well as requirements for memory safety, fault isolation etc. - we are targeting a wasm32-unknown-unknown compilation target of a wasm runtime that at least supports WASI + has plugins that are capabilities-based -- if the node is on a giant GPU server vs the node is in someone's smart refrigerator after-market firmware environment, it will acquire different capabilities, and so it is fair to say the purpose of our node is to be adaptable.

In all of these cases, the node will execute several pieces of software that we collectively call "microworld" in aggregate, but effectively may consist of one or several wasm modules each responsible for a variety of contexts of the state machine of node's lifecycle, but invariably all the contexts of use, hardware, networked capabilities etc. have to:

- be interoperable - nodes need to be able to form meshes / lattices
- respect the configurable choices of individual agencies* in terms of privacy and acceptable use of the data

Specifically, either it is one node, or a mesh of nodes with agency guiding computation choices, the ability to speak any language of existing technology, be it composite like IBC, or baseline like HTTP, or gRPC, or even HPC technologies etc. - the fact that our mesh will not be a chain will not prevent it from being seen as one when it opens a channel to, say, Osmosis.

We are also working on a device architecture for our first hardware node that is converging rapidly:
https://github.com/plurigrid/ontology/blob/main/log/03-31-plurigrid-nexus.md

We can have an outpost on any chain. Important mechanisms that might initially utilize token standards, such as ERC-20 in a variety of or, will eventually be transitioned into grid-IBC using an approach similar to Axelar's solution or the IBC light client verification. This ensures that the essence of Plurigrid's interoperability and flexibility is retained. By transitioning mechanisms into grid-IBC, the protocol can maintain seamless communication with a wide range of ecosystems while reinforcing the decentralized and adaptive nature of the Plurigrid network. This approach allows the project to stay focused on its core vision of building a collaborative and innovative decentralized energy platform.

Above all, it is our fully considered aspiration for the program is to make it so that every Coinbase Wallet user can pay for their electricity bill and participate in p2p energy trading commons, that is also facilitated by the corresponding grid world / grid diffusion infrastructure being in a sustainable loop, to secure the integrity of any mechanisms and allow for "island mode" operation of their microgrids. Enable new funding models under the NounsDAO model for Microworld NFTs and discover the value of simulation _and_ establish a circular economy along simulate / execute / simulate adjustments that are compatible with system level behavior of the grid.

Top priorities have converged on, by demo day:
- 1000+ microworlds + visual rendering in a grid designer UI: https://github.com/plurigrid/microworlds
- 1000+ deployments (local and cloud) of our Protocol, to include conversational grid agent supporting ALL languages, and a GPT4All / ALPACA (distilled from LLAMA) / or better yet, an _open_ but also commercially usable foundation model available on any node; decentralized expansion planning simulation; beginnings of open game engine as described here: https://cybercat.institute/projects/
- an app (mobile / desktop)
- privacy for DER / "prosumer" coalitions operating in ways that already allow for coalitions to form 
- several hardware dev kit designs prototypes warranting additional growth injection for global expansion, for which we hope to be ready by...
   - establishing the minimum viable base of operation of the protocol in several other global outposts, but also including here in San Francisco where the author is writing this from, and other parts of the US (NYC, Texas, LA): our devices in the most effective loop configuration already facilitating value elicitation, coalition formation, and algorithmic choice about smart grid operation
- a source of recurring revenue from a contract at the right scale of operational capability of our team or that within reach through addition of talent - either private microgrid associated with a community, municipal, or federal government; establish a foothold in defense and contracting sector for security uses, modeling after Palantir, Galois etc.
- a set of board candidates lined up for the next stage of growth consisting of top experts in energy sector and at least one categorical cyberneticist

enormous amount of adoption of conversational agents internally, would love to invite you to try it out and solve your microgrid / transactive energy coordination needs, a good entry point is microworld 001 or microworld 006, and here is what one worlding session may play out like:
