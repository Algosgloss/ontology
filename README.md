Leverage Git with Merge Queues and Obsidian Autosync for Seamless Collaboration :rocket:

To ensure seamless collaboration with Git by preserving the history of edits as granular as possible using merge queues and Obsidian autosync, follow these steps:

Step 1: Enable Obsidian Autosync
Configure Obsidian's autosync feature to automatically sync your vault with your remote Git repository. Enable "Automatic sync" in the "Sync" core plugin settings and set a suitable sync interval.

Step 2: Adopt GitHub Flow
Implement the GitHub Flow for your collaborative workflow. This involves creating feature branches for each specific task and merging them back into the main branch upon completion.

Step 3: Configure Merge Queues
- In your GitHub repository, go to the settings for merge queues.
- Choose "merge" as the merge method to preserve granular commit and tree history.
- Configure build concurrency, merge limits, and status check timeouts according to your team's needs.
- Enable the branch protection setting "Require merge queue", and set required status checks for your main branch.

Step 4: Git Best Practices
- Regularly push and pull changes using Obsidian autosync to keep local vaults updated with remote repository changes.
- Encourage descriptive commit messages to maintain a readable commit history.
- Merge pull requests into the main branch after appropriate reviews and resolving feedback.

By following these steps and adopting the GitHub Flow combined with Obsidian autosync and GitHub merge queues, your team can successfully collaborate in a seamless and conflict-free manner while preserving a granular history of edits. ðŸš€
