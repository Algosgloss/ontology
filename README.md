INVITATION: EACH TIME YOU PLAY AND IT MADE YOUR DAY BETTER OR MADE YOU SMILE,
LEAVE THIS BETTER THAN YOU HAD FOUND IT, FOR WHEN WE ALL PLAY AGAIN. ðŸŒ³

Play / Coplay: the Plurigrid Way :rocket:
Step 1: Begin Your Journey (gm -> gn)

Start your day with a "Good morning" message and share your goals. Close the loop before signing off by leaving a "Good night" message with a summary of your day.

Step 2: Generate Proposals & Collaborate

Leverage the OpenAgencies framework for brainstorming, collaborate using platforms operating on interoperable data formats, and any tool that complies with working on the data streams and in compliance with Digital Public Goods framework (for markdown, like Obsidian, GitHub, etc.) work; and most importantly contribute your improvements to the Plurigrid ontology via Pull Requests on an ongoing basis. The feedback loop at Plurigrid is continuous, and the ones rewarded are those playing next to the top.

Step 3: Iterative & Adaptive Development

Monitor and fine-tune your progress, adapting as needed. Embrace a human-in-the-loop approach, learning from other team members and the groundbreaking AI founder concept.
