- 24h model predicting capacity and demand tells you that you won't have enough  
- you need to buy x kWh on spot market which exceeds your budget  
- someone is willing to match capacity commitment to their local microgrid and may have more than what they need (if there are buy orders), or if not extend that
- Then, eventually, the original e-gen produces excess (on a sunny day) and the proceeds from selling it back will be owed to the original person
- This process is too slow to be done in real time, so amounts are predicted through day-ahead model
- By having the best models because we will train with private data in a confidential setting, we will efficiently allocate capacity and reconfigure inverters for predicted outcome better than e-gens or centralized planners
- TL;DR what is traded are energy futures decentralized equivalent and at the micro scale
- The distant e-gens get matched based on their stated intent and other pluralistic choices that get formally specified

0. [https://research.paradigm.xyz/cosmos-thesis](https://research.paradigm.xyz/cosmos-thesis) extending this to maximally provide blockspace sovereignty and practical way of self-sustaining resilient consensus mechanism to benefit from network effects enabled by interoperability, and concretely in existence of trajectories that go towards the now-reachable equilibrium state(s)  
  
1. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9735267](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9735267) - it is very ok to state this formally in terms of graphs, but how do we get there? how do we effectively solve for the problem setup in II. Several other formalisms exist that can describe and provide for properties of what the "gmi" outcome looks like, but again, not how to get there:

2. the plurality of the instances of our protocol operating in feedback / control loops will attempt to cover this effectiveness gap by designing / discovering mechanisms and rulesets for a better set of "games to play" in transactive energy markets - better, resilient market designs - that eventually will be necessary for all the scales and points of intermediation in grid operation today (DER, CCA, transmission, new generation construction, edge to futures, nuclear reactor construction financing, labor organizing and so on, and so on), as well as using the mechanism of "inertia" in programmable prices that seeks to drive transactive energy choices at every scale towards inertia in the actual grid of the future -- a more dynamical, increasingly chaotic and vulnerable grid  
  
3. this approach at the end of the day aims to increase the efficiencies in the grid and guide its sustainable expansion, operation, and resilience via...  
  
3.1 ...increasing access to financial services and trust in deployment of capital under new collaborative finance / mutual credit approaches that make networks of value, more resilient through coalition formation, economic security, and fee mechanisms / tokenomics design for both the economy and gradual ownership optimizatin.  
  
3.2 ...as well as coordinating networked "spooky action by anons at a distance" ![ðŸ”‹](node_modules/emoji-datasource-apple/img/apple/64/1f50b.png)![ðŸª«](node_modules/emoji-datasource-apple/img/apple/64/1faab.png)![ðŸ“‰](node_modules/emoji-datasource-apple/img/apple/64/1f4c9.png) by those in Plurigrid or many instances of Plurigrid to reconfigure the balance of power through systematic disintermediation of a variety of the corrupted / corruptible communication channels and entrenched enablers of monopolies on violence that are there today, as well as more banal unreflective equilibria we have arrived at (by participation in rate negotiation w/ transmission operators, governments and so on, on behalf of the constituencies being served, coordinating around systematic undercutting of the large utility monopolies in the spot markets, as well as more drastic measures for those in the darker corners of the world where the adversarial ontologies inhabited by participants in the existing "power games" as they are today need a direct reminder of the radical transformative power of cooperation of the free everywhere)
