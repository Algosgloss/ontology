- energy management systems operate microgrids, and there are centralized or decentralized ones 
- a lot of research has been conducted on computational EMS using the following techniques: 
	- fuzzy logic, fuzzy cognitive maps, genetic algorithms, neural networks 
- furthermore, multi-agent systems is a recent area of research 
	- exploit a theoretical framework relying on cooperation of the agents 
- game theory allows us to study both cooperative and competitive scenarios 
- the agents here (crucially) are not humans, but software agents which manage components of the grid with utility functions

questions

- what is a coalition in game theory? 
- do the NREL julia libraries allow for simulating different types of load distribution? still need to flesh out how those libraries fit in
