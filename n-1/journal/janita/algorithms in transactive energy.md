There are several algorithms that have been proposed in research on transactive energy for decentralized coordination of power grids, including:

1.  Game theoretic algorithms: These algorithms use game theory to model the interactions between agents in the power grid, and to find equilibrium solutions that are efficient and fair. Examples include auction-based algorithms, such as the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, and cooperative game theoretic algorithms, such as the Shapley value.
    
2.  Machine learning algorithms: These algorithms use techniques from machine learning, such as reinforcement learning and neural networks, to learn the behavior of agents in the power grid and to optimize their decisions.
    
3.  Optimization algorithms: These algorithms use mathematical optimization techniques, such as linear programming and nonlinear programming, to find optimal solutions for the coordination of the power grid.
    
4.  Distributed consensus algorithms: These algorithms enable the agents in the power grid to reach consensus on a common decision, by using techniques such as distributed averaging, or distributed optimization. These algorithms can be used to solve problems such as state estimation and optimal power flow.
    
5.  Blockchain-based algorithms: These algorithms use blockchain technology to establish trust and transparency among the agents in the power grid, and to enable secure and decentralized communication and transactions.
    

It is worth mentioning that these algorithms are not mutually exclusive and can be combined in different ways to achieve better results depending on the specific problem at hand. Also, research in this field is active, and new algorithms and approaches are constantly being proposed.
