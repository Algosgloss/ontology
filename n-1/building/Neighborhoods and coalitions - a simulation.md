### Scenario 0

**Agents**

- A neighborhood: A few solar panels and households with smart thermostats and applicances,  EV chargers, and EV batteries 

**Mechanism**

- The solar panel generators and EV batteries want to sell energy back to the grid. This is done via a double auction mechanism.  

**What we aim to demonstrate**

- We demonstrate, using real grid usage data, that selling energy via a double auction mechanism demonstrates more returns for electricity sellers, more cost savings for electricity consumers, and more renewable penetatration in the grid. 

### Scenario 1

**Agents**

- A coalition of agents in microgrid, including renewable energy producers, smart meters, and battery systems

**Mechanism**

- The agents perform a coalition formation game to cooperate to both sell excess electricity back to other microgrids, and to schedule demand shifting within the microgrid. The profits are distributed amongst the players using a fair allocation algorithm such as Shapley Value or Nucleolus.

**What we aim to demonstrate**

- The agents can gain more profit by joining the coalition than by operating independently, and more renewable energy is utilized in the grid.

### Scenario 2

**Agents**

- A neighborhood: energy consumers such as households with smart thermostats, applicances, and EV chargers

**Mechanism**

- The agents, using predictive modeling on usage data, decide when to schedule energy consumption.

**What we aim to demonstrate**

- We aim to demonstrate that, using smarter modeling and real-time signals, we can outperform existing demand response mechanisms such as time-of-use pricing.

### Scenario 3

**Agents**

- A  coalition: a broader grouping of households, generators, and batteries who are interested in buying energy

**Mechanism**

- The coalition, with access to more granular usage data, RL models, and more bargaining power, can better predict its energy needs and participates in a spot market.

**What we aim to demonstrate**

- We aim to demonstrate, given real world data and better predictive models, that an energy federation may trade wholesale energy and reduce the costs of energy for everyone involved.
