Drawing inspiration from C's approach to language extensions and ABI handling, let's consider an architecture and development strategy for connecting ABIs with WASM in a minimal, fast, and portable way.

### Architecture

1. **WASM Hardware Abstraction Library (HAL)**: Develop a hardware abstraction library for your target platform, focusing on exposing the required firmware instructions and hardware features to your WASM applications through an ABI-compliant interface.
  
2. **WASM Extension Modules**: Create small, reusable WebAssembly modules that utilize the HAL mentioned above. These modules will act as the interface between WebAssembly applications and hardware-specific functionality, offering consistent access to firmware instructions across varying applications.
  
3. **WASM Application**: Develop the main WebAssembly application that incorporates the necessary extension modules developed in Step 2. The application can now use the functions provided by these modules to interact with firmware instructions in a platform-agnostic manner.

### Development Strategy and Timeline

1. **Analysis and Research (Weeks 1-2)**: Analyze the required firmware instructions and hardware features, and research existing libraries or APIs that might be leveraged for the target platform. Understand the target platform's ABI specifics like calling conventions, register usage, and memory layout to ensure compliance.

2. **WASM Hardware Abstraction Library (Weeks 3-5)**: Develop the WASM HAL for your target platform, including all necessary functions and data types to expose the required firmware instructions and hardware features to your WebAssembly applications. Ensure ABI compliance and test the library thoroughly with platform-specific requirements.

3. **WASM Extension Module Development (Weeks 6-8)**: Develop small, reusable WebAssembly extension modules that leverage the WASM HAL API to provide platform-agnostic access to firmware instructions. Test and optimize these modules for performance and portability.

4. **Integration and Testing (Weeks 9-10)**: Integrate the WASM extension modules into the main WebAssembly application, and test the combined functionality with real-world use cases on the target platform. Troubleshoot and optimize the implementation throughout the testing process.

5. **Fine-tuning and Documentation (Weeks 11-12)**: Finalize your implementation, addressing any remaining issues, and write thorough documentation for usage, development, and maintenance aspects.

6. **Sharing and Collaborating**: Share your implementation with relevant communities, gather feedback, and continue to iterate on the architecture.

This development strategy aims to produce a flexible, portable, and performant solution for connecting ABIs with WASM while maintaining the ability to adjust the approach during development. By focusing on modular, reusable components, the architecture can be adapted to accommodate new hardware features or changes in requirements as needed throughout the development process.
