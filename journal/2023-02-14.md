# Jasmine Energy
EAC - Energy Attribute Credit
## Outcomes
### Metagame
- EAC joins as Plurigrid
  - Plurigrid Jasmine Energy
    - plurigrid-gradio35654.gradio.io
      - question answering Chain
      - Plurigrid Chain
      - Plurigrid + Jasmine Chain (e.g. LangChain)
      - outputs plausible conversational points
        (ðŸ‘½ respond to whisper live and "human prompt hack")
### Near term
- initial introduction Plurigrid <> Jasmine
- establish trust and non-adversarial modality
- scope out Neutral and who they think the most interesting players are
### Long term
- EAC + Plurigrid = how?
  - ERC-20 (fungible token) means need to run on EVM chain reachable w/ risk spread signals connected to Plurigrid via IBC <> gridIBC
  - e.g. High Risk: bridge from Polygon through Axelar / Squid to Juno / Osmisis
  - ERC-721 (non-fungible token) burn <> mint or mint a special edition
