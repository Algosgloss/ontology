- this paper was basically providing a taxonomy and overview of all of the different types of coordination strategies presented in different papers on this topic. very good paper


- coordination of DERs, grid-edge resources, could majorly contribute to decarbonisation of the grid 
- this paper provides an overview of the current literature and also presents a taxonomy of all the currently proposed strategies
- Demand response: incentivizes electricity customers to reduce their electricity use during periods of high demand on the grid.
- trade-off exists between the richness of information that can be shared between individuals and the privacy of that information 
- direct control: units forfeit their data to a centralized entity which designs optimal solutions 
	- using reinforcement learning-based optimisations, for example 
-indirect control:
	- mediated coordination: central entity collects information about prosumers and redistributes back to them 
		- auction theory, optimisation theory 
		- it is not guaranteed that prosumers will have the will to engage with information 
	- bilateral coordination: users communicate directly with each other 
		- bilateral competition: peers directly negotiate energy transactions with one another and chose trades to maximize utility 
			- risks: prosumers may not exhibit perfect rationality as it is cognitively demanding
		- bilateral coordination: agents  cooperatively implement theoretically-proven market solutions for the whole system 
		- some bilateral cooperation strategies (follow up): 
			- dual decomposition, alternativng direction method of multipliers
			- Lagrangian multipliers
	implicit coordination: 
		- prosumers do not share personal information but make decisions based on wider information environment
			- implicit competition is the status quo scenario -- ie critical use pricing, time of use pricing, etc. 
			- 

- hm, so it seems for each of these categories, there is a coordination / competition dichotomy, and strategies in the latter are more to do with energy trading whereas strategies in the former are prosumers trying to 

- optimal real-time operation of energy resources will involve both optimisation techniques and market-based approaches

- when choosing a strategy: how many people will this benefit, and by how much? and: is this the most effective thing we can do? 

**questions**

- what is virtual storage
- pareto-efficiency was a theme recently in the anoma paper and this edge of the electricity grid paper. need to dig further 
- why would a prosumer engage in this? what do they have to gain?
