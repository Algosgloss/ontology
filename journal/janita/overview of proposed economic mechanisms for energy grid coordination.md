There are a few economic mechanisms that have been proposed in peer-to-peer (P2P) energy and transactive energy research papers in recent years that are based on blockchain technology. These include:

1.  Token-based systems: In these systems, tokens are used as a means of exchange for energy, and the number of tokens held by a participant represents their energy assets. The tokens can be traded on a blockchain-based platform, allowing participants to buy and sell energy directly.
    
2.  Auction-based systems: In these systems, an auction is held on a blockchain platform to match buyers and sellers of energy. The price of energy is determined through the auction process, and participants can bid for or sell energy at a mutually agreed upon price.
    
3.  Predictive markets: In these systems, participants can buy and sell tokens that represent a prediction about future energy prices or demand. The market price of the tokens reflects the collective wisdom of the participants, and the tokens can be traded on a blockchain platform.
    
4.  Smart contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They can be used to automate the buying and selling of energy on a blockchain platform, allowing for automatic settlement of transactions based on predefined rules.
    

These are just a few of the economic mechanisms that have been proposed in P2P energy and transactive energy research papers in recent years. There are many other mechanisms that have been proposed as well, and the field is rapidly evolving.
