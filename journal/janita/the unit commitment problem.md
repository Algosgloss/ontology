The unit commitment problem is a decision-making problem in the energy industry that involves determining which power plants should be turned on or off and at what times, in order to meet the electricity demand at the lowest cost, while also considering various constraints such as capacity limitations, ramp rates, start-up and shut-down costs, and emissions regulations. The unit commitment problem is an optimization problem that involves finding the optimal operating schedule for a portfolio of power plants, taking into account the expected demand for electricity and the cost of operating each plant. The solution to the unit commitment problem can have a significant impact on the cost of electricity, the reliability of the power grid, and the environmental impact of electricity generation. As such, it is an important problem in the management of electricity networks and is widely studied in the fields of operations research and power systems engineering.
