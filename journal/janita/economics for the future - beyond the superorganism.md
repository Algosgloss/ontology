- the backdrop: we're emitting CO2 at unprecedented rates, and the global economy is becoming increasingly extractive and unsustainable 
- once agricultural surplus began, jobs and hierarchies began
- 19th century: discovery of fossil carbon and invention of technologies to use it as fuel 
- 20th century: unprecedented growth, 21st century: beginning to see resource constraints and unrest again 
- because of abundance-hijacked dopamine pathways, we become addicted to a never ending cycle of unexpected rewards 
- humans are not rational, deeper more emotional systems rule our thought
	- lots of cognitive biases which prevent us from being rational actors 
	- our brains make it hard to plan for the future 
- humans have formed a superorganism, the global economy 
- ecological economics: humans and systems are completely dependent on energy
	- "energy is and always will be the currency of life"
- because fossil energy is a lot cheaper than human energy, major transitions in industrialization and economic growth as a result were reliant on cheap fossil energy 
- the availability and cost of energy dictate our ability to output 
	- until the 1970s, energy consumption and GDP output were nearly perfectly correlated 
- mainstream economic theory considers energy as subsititutable with any other input having the same cost (when in fact, energy can only be substituted with other energy)
- money is created by being loaned into existence. This will get spent on goods or services that embody energy. Therefore money is a claim on energy but its creation is not tethered to energy availability or cost. 
- I don't fully understand this: "debt moves energy consumption forward from the future, unsustainably"
	- I guess if I thought about it more, I would say that if money is just embodied energy, then debt is borrowing against that so you can consume more energy, now (but it is unsustainable to be able to pay that back in the future )
- human brains are linked to energy use through the "pursuit of comfort" and the "avoidance of pain". comfort in the modern world is directly tied to energy consumption 
- the global 'superorganism' which perpetually seeks unbounded growth (and thereby energy expenditure) is a 'mindless' creature that no one is really in control of, but that everyone is a part of 
- it will not be possible to decarbonize the economy without reducing economic growth 
- the energy and finance link has been obfuscated because we keep consuming on credit 
- major thing to understand: the debt is borrowed energy which we cannot pay back, and the idea that we keep "kicking the can forward" unsustainably 

**why this is relevant to plurigrid**

This paper hits at the core of Plurigrid's thesis -- that decentralized energy can allow for the most action spaces to reach the required coordination potential / disintermediate the entities that corrupt signal; that mutual credit & obligation clearing tied to intent matching based on energy as the universal medium of exchange will over time replace MMT and money as we know it; that validity predicates & equilibria-seeking open games w/ agency can allow for a degree of assurance in our systems to counteract the so-called "social traps" that the paper calls out!
