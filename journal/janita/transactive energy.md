- traditional power system operation: bulk generation --> transmitted over long distances --> low voltage household usage 
- when customers become prosumers, they can generate power themselves 

- users are generating their own energy and trying to minimize the (cost of energy imported - the revenue generated from the energy they generate)
- the voltages in the network can't be too high such as to trip inverters 
- current state of the art: direct load is controlled by retailer, customer demand prefereneces are not taken into account 
- peer to peer is not possible for long distances with low voltage networks
	- so you are restricted to doing it in your local low voltage network
- auction based energy trading: 
	- continuous double auction
	- bids can be listed on blockchain 

**chat with barton**

- energy has to be used when it is generated
- what we are doing is translating some of that information using mutual credit protocol
	- lending kilowatt hours 
- we want peer to peer communication 

**what would I be doing**

- implementing cosmwasm incentive structures that we saw in the video 
- plurigrid spawns new chains as necessary

**augmented bonding curve**

- inflationary tokenomics
- have a mechanism which allows funding to be done in a regionally-specific 
- ABC will allow us to create energy coordination commons
- the value of our protocol will be realized by those to whom the energy belongs
