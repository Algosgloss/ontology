**Synchronous machines**

- Synchronous machines help maintain the stability of the grid by providing active power in response to changes in load, providing reactive power to maintain constant voltage, providing damping torque to maintain rotor angle stability and ensuring that all generators remain in synchronization.

- A virtual synchronous machine (VSM) is a type of advanced control system used in power systems to provide grid-forming capabilities for renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.

**grid frequency and voltage**

- Grid frequency is a measure of the number of oscillations of the AC voltage on the grid per second. It is usually measured in hertz (Hz). The nominal grid frequency is typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz, depending on the country. Any deviation from the nominal frequency can indicate a problem in the power system and can lead to disturbances in the grid.

- Grid voltage is a measure of the electric potential difference between two points on the grid. It is usually measured in volts (V). The nominal grid voltage is typically around 400 V or 230 V, depending on the country. Any deviation from the nominal voltage can indicate a problem in the power system and can lead to disturbances in the grid.

- Maintaining a constant grid frequency and voltage is crucial for the stability and reliability of the power system. This can ensure that the power supply is reliable and that equipment is not damaged, leading to fewer power outages and equipment failures.
