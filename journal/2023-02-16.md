# Building expert systems in 2023
a step by step approach to a highly specialized information retrieval system like ChatGPT.
One trajectory:

- start with https://metaphor.systems and request the seed publication
- proceed to perplexity to formulate the first fully formed question and clarify https://www.perplexity.ai/?s=c&uuid=fbe5a85f-227e-4003-b3c3-70edf2a1645e
- any reference material keep track of and use as "origins" of the graph at the https://connectedpapers.com
- collect any referenced material - industry reports, standards, legislation and other papers - no mattetr how dated (e.g. 1997 conference on Virtual Utility https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4615-6167-5?page=2#toc)
- prioritize quality sources or ones that have already informed understanding https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9915599
- iterate until enough corpus material is collected to begin the process of either zero-shot prompting of the aligned foundation model OR fine-tuning under classic scenario

Using an appropriate memory / context setting for future reuse, e.g. `ConversationKGMemory`, begin specialization of a more general LLM (or multimodal foundation model if audio / video present -- e.g. podcasts, lectures etc.)

once the model is sufficiently specialized, begin interrogating about factual knowledge as established by the "agent certification standards"
= if ChatGPT makes a factually incorrect statement about computer science like "a Turing machine can be implemented using a Finite State Machine" (which is provably incorrect), consider the expert system non-agentic (~= Voigt-Kampf test)
