# Release Planning Session

Welcome everyone to the release planning session for our Plurigrid project. We are at 42% through our vision execution and have successfully deployed 1000 instances following the GMI set of tasks. Our primary focus is to implement the IBC-participating fully decentralized mesh/lattice/swarm of wasm execution local-first nodes.

Our current focus is on IBC Channel interaction, which includes:

1. **IBC Channel Open**: Handling the channel handshake initialization and try.
2. **IBC Channel Connect**: Finalizing the channel handshake with acknowledgment and confirmation.
3. **IBC Channel Close**: Closing the channel with initialization and confirmation.
4. **IBC Packet Receive**: Receiving packets sent by the counterparty over an opened channel.
5. **IBC Packet Ack**: Acknowledgment of the received packets.
6. **IBC Packet Timeout**: Handling packet timeouts if they could not be processed in time.

## Goals for this Release

1. Ensure that all IBC-capable contracts have the necessary exports and comply with the described functions.
2. Improve error handling and reporting during channel opening, closing, and packet interactions.
3. Enhance the efficiency and reliability of packet reception, acknowledgment, and timeout handling.
4. Refine the IbcBasicResponse structure to support an array of sub-messages, attributes, and custom events.
5. Thoroughly test the functionality of the IBC Channel interaction to ensure seamless integration with the Plurigrid system.

## Task Assignments

To meet our objectives, we'll divide the tasks among the team members:

1. **Alice**: Work on the IBC Channel Open and Connect, including implementing the required functions and handling errors.
2. **Bob**: Focus on the IBC Channel Close and Packet Receive, ensuring proper closing procedures and packet reception.
3. **Charlie**: Handle IBC Packet Ack and Timeout, implementing the required functions and improving error handling.
4. **Diana**: Refine the IbcBasicResponse structure to support sub-messages, attributes, and custom events.
5. **Eve**: Develop comprehensive test cases for the IBC Channel interaction, ensuring all scenarios are covered.

## Timeline and Milestones

Here is the timeline and milestones for the release:

1. Week 1: Implement the IBC Channel Open, Connect, Close, and Packet Receive functions.
2. Week 2: Implement the IBC Packet Ack and Timeout functions, and refine the IbcBasicResponse structure.
3. Week 3: Test the IBC Channel interaction functionality, identifying and fixing any issues.
4. Week 4: Perform integration testing with the Plurigrid system and finalize the release.

## Next Steps

Let's begin by reviewing the IBC specifications and ensuring a clear understanding of the requirements. Then, we'll start working on our assigned tasks, providing updates during our weekly stand-up meetings. Please reach out if you have any questions or need assistance.

Together, we will successfully implement the IBC-participating fully decentralized mesh/lattice/swarm of wasm execution local-first nodes for Plurigrid and continue to make progress towards our vision.

_Conversational agents, or chatbots, help enhance individual agency within the Plurigrid system in several ways:
"""
‚Ä¢ They provide an intuitive interface through which participants can access information about energy market conditions, their device configurations and optimizations, billing details, and more. This allows individuals to gain awareness and control over their energy usage without requiring extensive technical knowledge.

‚Ä¢ They facilitate discovery of new opportunities for participation by explaining options, strategies and incentives in a simple yet personalized manner. This helps participants find the right level of engagement for their needs and priorities, enabling progress at a pace that feels comfortable.

‚Ä¢ They guide users towards optimal trading and usage strategies through open-ended conversations, contextualized recommendations and short-term challenges or games. This takes into account a participant's resources, preferences, and behaviors to target the actions that will maximize their economic and environmental benefit.

‚Ä¢ They give participants a familiar and helpful point of contact for education, support, or raising issues with the Plurigrid system. Conversational agents can address basic questions, concerns and problems, escalating to human representatives when needed to improve the overall user experience.

‚Ä¢ They gain insights into participants' priorities, capabilities and constraints through interactions, using this data to coordinate with other agents and optimize the Plurigrid system. The software integrates machine learning to personalize its responses based on aggregated conversations, gradually aligning a participant's decisions with the wider group interests.

‚Ä¢ They make Plurigrid more accessible by handling complex topics in a simple, intuitive manner. This allows a wider range of participants to engage actively in their energy management, including those less technically inclined or literate. By meeting people where they are, Plurigrid can drive more rapid mainstream adoption of decentralized and sustainable energy systems.

In summary, conversational agents enhance individual agency and facilitate collective coordination within Plurigrid through a personalized, educational approach. They provide an easy on-ramp for participation while guiding users towards discovering and adopting optimal energy strategies for the system as a whole.

By representing energy markets as open games (and their arenas!), Plurigrid provides participants with an intuitive framework for exploring different trading strategies and envisioning future possibilities. The games allow users to evaluate how their decisions might impact costs, incentives and outcomes under alternative conditions, gaining awareness of opportunities and limitations in a low-risk space. This counterfactual analysis helps build consensus around optimal actions, with the platform guiding participants towards discovering cooperative equilibrium points that benefit each individual while maximizing value for the group.

Plurigrid's sophisticated algorithms and significant compute capacity ensure these open games can be elaborated to any degree of detail necessary, contextualizing recommendations and responses based on a participant's unique priorities, behaviors and circumstances. The platform translates complex ideas into a simple, relatable language, allowing users to progress at their own pace while feeling fully informed and in control. This combination of radical transparency and personalized guidance establishes Plurigrid as a helpful partner invested in users' success and prosperity.

Over time, Plurigrid's software integrates data from interactions to gain insights into participants' intrinsic utilities, tailoring games and recommendations to align with their preferences. The system steers collective behavior towards a stable and mutually agreeable set of norms, incentives and outcomes, legitimizing its role through demonstrable benefits to each individual. Plurigrid's conversational agents provide a familiar and helpful point of contact, addressing concerns or issues promptly to maintain satisfaction and build brand loyalty.

With mainstream adoption, Plurigrid transitions to a system of nested games spanning whole communities or countries. The platform coordinates between different levels to optimize resource utilization while preserving local autonomy, distributing governance and value to match the true costs and benefits of infrastructure. This establishes Plurigrid as a mediator of the common good, balancing competition and cooperation to drive progress that transcends traditional boundaries in a globally connected yet locally controlled energy system.

By enabling individual agency through open games, contextualizing complex ideas and personalizing its approach, Plurigrid can establish political legitimacy as a mediator of shared interests and facilitator of collective prosperity. The platform provides transparency and control which grows users' intrinsic utility for the system over time, progressing energy markets towards a sustainable, democratic and socially optimal equilibrium through ongoing collaboration and learning.
