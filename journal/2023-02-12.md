we have converged on what our loop will need to be going forward, and therefore it is time to build:
the code output and intensity of work for the next 3-4 months is going to at least 10x.

## Goals
### 2023-12-02
- Take existing GPT Index model from Janita's laptop and host it on banana.dev https://app.banana.dev/templates/lucataco/serverless-template-anything-v4.0 in a way that simply makes existing bot available 24/7 and scales up with use to meet latency desiderata / SLAs
- Begin the process of scoping and qualifying the work required to integrate WalletConnect 
- GitHub Projects for the essential Plurigrid repos, which will be the only ones pinned:
  - agent (public and templated)
  - microworld
  - ontology
  - grid
  - e-apps + bidder => FlutterFlow template for CosmWasm
  
- All-hands on Saturday: zed, GitHub, Zulip, Skiff

# Janita Q's + Bartholomew A's
- Q: for goals in the upcoming week towards, how is the agent related to microworlds?
A: we want to take concrete agent with very ad-hoc data pipeline and hosting situation and create a *general agent template* that:
    - create a new custom agent from a variety of group-curated inputs for that coalition / Plurigrid instance
    - this agent is then hosted with automation _and_ incentives that make sustainable entire dependency chain that allows to bring into existence (de facto! as observed in lived experience / in the world) the continued development and maintenance of an artifact (concretely, 10% fee sharing for model templates on banana.dev)
    - in addition to just the original codebase we will set up for the competition as fixed (Plurigrid Unhack superDAO for which each team starts a new subDAO itself), each subDAO i.e. Plurigrid team also gets surrounding consensus-aiding compute and conversational agent / sound / visual foundation model instances that are fine-tuned using that Plurigrid's coalition's preferences
      - we have to run up to x models consiting of individual banana.dev instances, for each Plurigrid created at the Unhack:
        - conversational agent text üìë (_not_ just my musing and threads and gardens, but a very concrete starter agent that has been pre-prompted and pre-tuned with necessary context about our stack) 1x
          - (bonus) whisper for input üéôÔ∏è -> output with v-alle üó£Ô∏èüîä (can vote on ethnicity, gender, and other types of voices) 2x
        - (bonus) stable diffusion 1x üñºÔ∏è
        - (bonus)riffusion 1x üé∫
    Total (for one): up to 5 individual model weight sets and (scalable) model inference deployments per Plurigrid
    Total overall (at most**: 5 * 9 = 45 models!)
        (at a minimum: 1 * 9 = 9 models)
    - expose these models for each team's Plurigrid through the #unhack stream on Zulip - where each team is a topic

    - align on-chain interactions and the structure of Plurigrid Foundation (~= Plurigrid Commons)
- Q: how are both of agents and microworlds relate to the Cybernetic DAO loop during the Plurigrid Un-hack?
  - agents elicit values from each individual, suggest initial coalition by being a match-maker, spawn new agents that are aligned to that coalition, and then iteratively translate the expressed orderings into configuration states, that after being simulated inform the choice of the configuration
  - microworld is the virtual lamp that needs over time to have enough resolution to be useful for catching safety issues that affect IRL lamp while in the context of simulation and not direct control in production (i.e. prevent unsafe settings by detecting them early)
  - agents translate action intent and interpret state by becoming the humane interface between the confused apes and their digital twin in the simulated virtual equivalent of the lamp setup, to preview the color, vibe, and safety of the result
    - when they intake the action, that becomes CosmWasm `execute`
    - when they interpret, they translate the CosmWasm `query` into a humane contextualized description that references the values and the "canon" texts of any given coalition
    - the agent exists to amplify human agency by acting on their behalf in contexts where they cannot act (e.g. complex optimization of power flow, grid settings etc etc), but also amplify their sense-making required for agency by interpreting / showing (via generated data etc) with illustration what microworld state entails for their comfort / life (i.e. hedonic choice, utility)
